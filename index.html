<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Poems for the Millennium, Volume Four: The University of California Book of North African Literature</h2><p>In this fourth volume of the landmark <i>Poems for the Millennium</i> series, Pierre Joris and Habib Tengour present a comprehensive anthology of the written and oral literatures of the Maghreb, the region of North Africa that spans the modern nation states of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania, and including a section on the influential Arabo-Berber and Jewish literary culture of Al-Andalus, which flourished in Spain between the ninth and fifteenth centuries. Beginning with the earliest pictograms and rock drawings and ending with the work of the current generation of post-independence and diasporic writers, this volume takes in a range of cultures and voices, including Berber, Phoenician, Jewish, Roman, Vandal, Arab, Ottoman, and French. Though concentrating on oral and written poetry and narratives, the book also draws on historical and geographical treatises, philosophical and esoteric traditions, song lyrics, and current prose experiments. These selections are arranged in five chronological &#x201c;diwans&#x201d; or chapters, which are interrupted by a series of &#x201c;books&#x201d; that supply extra detail, giving context or covering specific cultural areas in concentrated fashion. The selections are contextualized by a general introduction that situates the importance of this little-known culture area and individual commentaries for nearly each author.</p><p>&#x201c;This comprehensive anthology of North African texts is the first of its kind available in English. The editors&#x2019; scholarship is impeccable, as is their selection, translation, and contextualization of the works presented here. Joris and Tengour demonstrate a deep understanding and intimate knowledge not only of the texts, but also the cultural context and literary processes of North Africa.&#x201d;&#x2015;Silvia Nagy-Zekmi, author of <i>Transatlantic Parallelisms</i><br><br>&#x201c;One might think that the literary works of North Africa are off the map of Western Civilization. No one who reads this book will think that ever again. This comprehensive anthology of writers both famous and unfamiliar&#x2015;spanning an enormous sweep of more than two millennia&#x2015; compels us to integrate the Maghreb into our understanding of European and Middle Eastern literature. With these compelling and informative translations, Joris and Tengour make crystal clear that this region has a claim on being one of the wellsprings of the culture we value in the West. In so doing, they restore to us a missing part of the &#x2018;cradle&#x2019; of our civilization.&#x201d;&#x2015;Charles Bernstein, author of <i>Attack of the Difficult Poems: Essays and Inventions</i>Pierre Joris is a Professor of English at SUNY, Albany and an acclaimed translator and editor. as well as the author of many books of poetry.

(Penguin classics)</h2><p><p>Lenin-s work <em>What Is To Be Done</em>? was written at the end of 1901 and early in 1902. In -Where To Begin-, published in <em>Iskra</em>, No. 4 (May 1901), Lenin said that the article represented -a skeleton plan to be developed in greater detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for print-. </p> <p>Lenin began the actual writing of the book in the autumn of 1901. In his -Preface to the Pamphlet <em>Documents of the -Unity- Conference</em>-, written in November 1901, Lenin said that the book was in preparation -to be published in the near future-. In December Lenin published (in <em>Iskra</em>, No. 12) his article -A Talk with Defenders of Economism-, which he later called a conspectus of <em>What Is To Be Done</em>? He wrote the Preface to the book in February 1902 and early in March the book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart.

A monument to sloth, rant and contempt, a behemoth of fat, flatulence and furious suspicion of anything modern - this is Ignatius J. Reilly of New Orleans, noble crusader against a world of dunces. In magnificent revolt against the twentieth century, Ignatius propels his monstrous bulk amongst the flesh-pots of a fallen city, documenting life on his Big Cief tablets as he goes - until his maroon-haired mother decrees that he must work.</p><p><i>"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."</i><p> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. </p><p> Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>When Walker Percy penned these prophetic words in his foreword to the first edition of A Confederacy of Dunces, he could not have known just how wide Toole's "world of readers" would become. Released by Louisiana State University Press in April 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Turned down by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today, there are over 1,500,000 copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages.<p>Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Percy dubs "slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one -- who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age". Ignatius' ire explodes when his mother backs her car into another automobile. The owner of the damaged vehicle insists on payment; Mrs. Reilly demands that her son cease watching television and writing in his Big Chief tablet and get a job.</p><p>Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presences -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levy Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses. Satire and farce animate A Confederacy of Dunces; tragic awareness ennobles it.</p><p>Louisiana State University Press celebrates A Confederacy of Dunces' twentieth year withthis anniversary edition, which includes a new introduction by Andrei Codrescu that examines the relationship of this modern-day classic to the city whose pulse it so brilliantly captures.</p></p><h2>Physics for Engineers and Scientists</h2><p><p><strong>Designed for the introductory calculus-based physics course,&nbsp;<em>Physics for Engineers and Scientists</em>&nbsp;is distinguished by its lucid exposition and accessible coverage of&nbsp;fundamental physical concepts.</strong></p> The text presents a modern view of classical mechanics and electromagnetism for today's science and engineering students, including coverage of optics and quantum physics and emphasizing the relationship between macroscopic and microscopic phenomena.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Organized to address specific concepts and then build on them, this highly readable text divides each chapter into short, focused sections followed by review questions.

States rely on records to tax and spend, protect and serve, discipline and punish. But time and again, this paperwork proves to be unreliable. Examining episodes that range from the story of a clerk who lost his job and then his mind in the French Revolution to an account of Roland Barthes's brief stint as a university administrator, Kafka reveals the powers, the failures, and even the pleasures of paperwork. Many of its complexities, he argues, have been obscured by the comic-paranoid style that characterizes much of our criticism of bureaucracy. Kafka proposes a new theory of what Karl Marx called the &#x201c;bureaucratic medium.&#x201d; Moving from Marx to Freud, he argues that this theory of paperwork must include both a theory of praxis and of parapraxis.</p></p><p>Ben Kafka is an Assistant Professor of Media History and Theory at New York University and a candidate at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR), a component society of the International Psychoanalytical Association. He works with adult and adolescent patients through the IPTAR Clinical Center and the NYC Free Clinic.<p>This remarkable book teaches everyone who has gone blind on paperwork to see modern life anew: forms and reports, the stultifying preserve of bureaucrats, emerge as the foundations (and sometimes undoing) of state power. With elegance and poise, Ben Kafka blends the erudition of a masterful historian of the French Revolution with the rigors of a materialist who knows concepts depend on their circulation and the sophistication of a psychoanalyst who understands the psychic implications of worldly transformation. Through the utopia of the 'paperless office,' Kafka gives the clerks who destroy and fulfill our dreams their due, and a neglected form of modern writing the centrality it demands. And make sure to have a pair of scissors on hand!</p>&#x2015;<b>Samuel Moyn</b>, author of <i>The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History</i><br><br><p>Ben Kafka's <i>The Demon of Writing</i> is an unexpected pleasure. The wit and intelligence that shine through the notorious recalcitrance and tedium of paperwork make it a joy to read. The real surprise, however, is the reach of the Kafka's project, the amount this history of a few episodes in the life of paper and ink, files and forms, has to teach us about the proximity of our expectations and frustrations with the modern bureaucratic state. It will be of particular interest to scholars interested in the contradictions of the revolutionary experience, but it will be equally rewarding to everyone who has dreamed of working in an office that works.</p>&#x2015;<b>James Swenson</b>, author of <i>On Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Considered as One of the First Authors of the Revolution</i><br><br><p>Kafka draws on methods and theories most often found in psychoanalysis, political theory, and histories of the book to craft a marvelously engaging and wonderfully witty study of papers, paperwork, and bureaucracy. At the center of this tremendously clever and pathos-laden interpretation is the crucial insight that 'paperwork, even when it works, fails us.

Women already overwhelmed by the burdens of poverty had no recourse; their doctors were either ignorant of effective methods of birth control or were unwilling to risk defying the law.<br>Sanger resolved to dedicate her life to establishing birth control as a basic human right. Her battles brought a world of troubles &#x2014; arrest, indictment, and exile among them &#x2014; but ultimately she triumphed, opening the first American birth control clinic in 1916 and serving as the first president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1953.<br>A fascinating firsthand account of an early crusade for women's healthcare, this autobiography is a classic of women's studies and social reform.</p></p><p></p><h2>HMH Physics: Teacher Edition 2017</h2><p>Brand new, Ships from NY</p><p></p><h2>ELEVATE MIDDLE GRADE SCIENCE 2019 FORCES STUDENT EDITION GRADE 6/8</h2><p><p><em>Elevate Science</em> offers 12 individual modules that span grades 6-8 and cover 100% of the NGSS Middle Grade Performance Expectations.

However, scientific research and evidence on the subject is scattered and sparse. Public and political opinions are often misinformed and out of proportion to the extent of the problem. Dog Bites brings together expert knowledge of the current situation, from a wide variety of disciplines, to provide information to the many people and professions affected by this issue. Subjects range from the practical, medical, behavioural, sociological, and theoretical, but the overall approach of the book is objective and integrative. Topics addressed include: the genetic basis of aggression; the public image of aggressive dogs; bite statistics; risk factors; the forensics and surgical aspects of dog bites; international legal perspectives; court evidence; first aid treatment; zoonotic disease potential; behavioural rehabilitation options; the risk to children; and a consideration of why some dogs kill. All contributors are academic or long-standing professional experts in their field, and they represent a wide spread of international expertise. This issue is an important one for pet owners, vets, animal shelters, and anyone who works with dogs, such as the police. This book will be a valuable resource for them, as well as for animal behaviourists, academic researchers, health professionals, dog breeders, and handlers. *** &#34;... the first comprehensive resource on the subject of dog bites... The overall intent of the book is to prevent dog bites. ...does a good job of compiling the information we think we know about dog bites into one place. It also debunks much of what were previously accepted truths about dog bites to humans. In the final chapter, the editors state they hope that &#39;highlighting the many deficiencies in our understanding will inspire rather than demoralize&#39; and that they &#39;have offered a point of reference not just to the problems but also the solutions&#39;&#34;. --Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 252, No. 6, March 15, 2018 [Subject: Veterinary Science, Public Policy, Animal Behavior, Animal Policing]</p><p>Daniel was Europe&#39;s first professor of veterinary behavioural medicine, he is also a RCVS, European and ASAB recognised specialist.

The text expands well beyond this basic information, however, providing as in-depth study of both ac and dc systems for virtually all varieties of aircraft. The text takes students through the fundamentals of electron theory and on to the study of aircraft digital control systems. Integrated into the text are various examples of troubleshooting techniques as they apply to aircraft systems. The text also provides details on a variety of general and commercial aircraft electrical/electronic systems, including avionic systems. One of the major changes in this edition is the modernization of material about electrical and electronic equipment to reflect current practices. Coverage of transistors and semiconductors, lighting systems, and nickel cadmium batteries has been updated while troubleshooting techniques using digital and analog meters have been added. </p><p> This edition includes a Student Study Guide that parallels the text. It provides fill-in-the-blank questions that identify key term, demonstrates applications of mathematical relationships, and validates learning progress by offering multiple-choice questions.

Chester, Austin Peay State University<br><br>The natural landscape of Tennessee represents a unique treasure for gardeners and nature lovers. Encompassing several geographically distinctive regions, from the 6,000-foot peaks of the Unaka Mountains to the swampy floodplain of the Mississippi River, the state boasts nearly 3,000 native plant species. This stunning diversity of life owes much to Tennessee&#x2019;s prime location at the crossroads of mountain and prairie ecosystems and in the transition area between northern and southern climate patterns.<br><br>In Gardening with the Native Plants of Tennessee, Margie Hunter gives gardeners the knowledge they need in order to nurture this natural heritage in their own gardens. Beginning with a survey of the state&#x2019;s ecology&#x2014;including geology, geography, plant life and animal species&#x2014;Hunter takes a holistic approach to the process of gardening with native plants. The book&#x2019;s main section provides detailed accounts of 450 species of wildflowers, ferns, grasses, vines, shrubs, and trees native to Tennessee and adjacent states. These descriptions, arranged according to plant type, include both scientific and common name, flowering and fruiting times, propagation methods, soil and light requirements, and distribution patterns within the state. Nearly 400 color photographs illustrate the species discussions.<br><br>No other book designed for the home gardener includes such area-specific information on native species or such a comprehensive listing of plants. Appendixes refer readers to other sources of information and seeds, including mail-order nurseries, botanical gardens, state agencies, native plant organizations, and subject-specific conferences. A detailed bibliography also contributes to the reference value of this book for gardeners, landscapers, and nature lovers throughout Tennessee and in neighboring states.<br><br>The Author: Margie Hunter, a long-time volunteer at Cheekwood Botanical Garden, lives in Nashville.<br></p><p>Margie Hunter, a long-time volunteer at Cheekwood Botanical Garden, lives in Nashville.<br></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Chapbook: A Compendium of Fact, Opinion, Wit, and Advice from the Twentieth Century&#39;s Preeminent Writers (Modern Library)</h2><p>The first issue of The Paris Review in 1953 included an interview on the craft of writing with E. M. Forster, perhaps the greatest living author of the time. Subsequent issues carried interviews with, among others, Fran�ois Mauriac, Graham Greene, Irwin Shaw, William Styron, Ralph Ellison, and William Faulkner; in the intervening years, many of the world's most significant writers (Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, and John Dos Passos) sat down with The Paris Review. Many of the interviews have been collected in a series of volumes entitled Writers at Work. From these interviews, The Paris Review's editor, George Plimpton, has selected the best and most illuminating insights that the writers have provided and arranged them by subject rather than by author. The book is divided into four parts: "The Writer: A Profile" (including the sections "On Reading," "On Work Habits," On the Audi-<br>ence," etc.); Part II is "Technical Matters" ("On Style," "On Plot," etc.); Part III is "Different Forms" ("On Biography," "On Journalism"); and Part IV is "The Writer's Life," covering topics like conferences, courses, and teaching, along with a section in which writers provided portraits of other writers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Writer's Chapbook is a fund of observations by writers on writing. These range from marvel-<br>ous one-liners (Eugene O'Neill on critics: "I love every bone in their heads"; T. S.

Nowhere is this truer than in the nerve-shattering chaos of warfare, where sight seems to confer objective truth and acts as the basis of reconstruction. In <em>The Smell of Battle, the Taste of</em> <em>Siege</em>, historian Mark M. Smith considers how all five senses, including sight, shaped the experience of the Civil War and thus its memory, exploring its full sensory impact on everyone from the soldiers on the field to the civilians waiting at home. <br><br>From the eardrum-shattering barrage of shells announcing the outbreak of war at Fort Sumter; to the stench produced by the corpses lying in the mid-summer sun at Gettysburg; to the siege of Vicksburg, once a center of Southern culinary aesthetics and starved into submission, Smith recreates how Civil War was felt and lived. Relying on first-hand accounts, Smith focuses on specific senses, one for each event, offering a wholly new perspective. At Bull Run, the similarities between the colors of the Union and Confederate uniforms created concern over what later would be called "friendly fire" and helped decide the outcome of the first major battle, simply because no one was quite sure they could believe their eyes. He evokes what it might have felt like to be in the HL Hunley submarine, in which eight men worked cheek by jowl in near-total darkness in a space 48 inches high, 42 inches wide. Often argued to be the first "total war," the Civil War overwhelmed the senses because of its unprecedented nature and scope, rendering sight less reliable and, Smith shows, forcefully engaging the nonvisual senses. Sherman's March was little less than a full-blown assault on Southern sense and sensibility, leaving nothing untouched and no one unaffected. <br><br>Unique, compelling, and fascinating, <em>The Smell of Battle, The Taste of Siege</em>, offers readers way to experience the Civil War with fresh eyes.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mark M. Smith</strong> is Carolina Distinguished Professor of History at the University of South Carolina and author or editor of a dozen books, including <em>Sensing the Past: Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and Touching in History </em>and <em>How Race Is Made: Slavery, the Senses, and Segregation. </em><br><br>"Smith's sensory history of the Civil War brings a dramatic new perspective to bear on this transformative event that gave rebirth to a nation .[A] foundational work, both in sensory history and in the emergent field of conflict and the senses. It yields many important insights into the lived experience of the Civil War, and is certain to inspire further research into what ranks as the most traumatic event in US history."--David Howes, <em>Southern Spaces</em><p></p><br>"[H]ighly readable prose....An able demonstration of sensory history..."--Alexandre F. Caillot, <em>H-War</em><p></p><br>"'The real war will never get in the books.' This may be the most famous sentence ever written about the Civil War... Even before its official start in 2011, the Civil War sesquicentennial has brought many attempts to prove [Walt] Whitman wrong...[P]erhaps most striking is the surge of books that belong to what might be called the school of gore--exemplified most recently by Mark M. Smith's <em>The Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege: A Sensory History of the Civil War</em>--books that almost seem to savor the range of ways in which living bodies were converted into corpses by fire or disease, in mud or in bed, quickly enough to block awareness of death's arrival, or slowly enough to taunt the dying with false promises of reprieve."--<em>The New York Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br>"Even for jaded Civil War readers who think they have explored the war from every conceivable angle, this is fresh material compellingly explored...Mr. Smith is onto something original and important, and his relentless intensity, rigorous attention to detail and dazzling vocabulary make for a beguiling, if occasionally numbing, read."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Eminently readable...<em>The Smell of Battle</em> is an unconventional history of the Civil War, written with special attention to olfaction, touch, taste, sight, and hearing. It joins other recent histories of the war--Drew Gilpin Faust's <em>This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War</em>; Michael C.C. Adams' <em>Living Hell: The Dark Side of the Civil War</em> -- in trying to represent the war's massive levels of death and disruption so that 21st-century readers will really <em>feel</em> the history, deep in their bones...Sensory history, <em>The Smell of Battle</em> makes clear, is more than just an exercise in providing colorful detail...A book like Smith's, which tries to put reports of sights, sounds, and tastes in context, is a powerful argument for the importance of reading original historical sources while trying to understand the social mores of the time."--<em>Slate</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege</em> is an incredible book, one not only to read but also to be felt. Using diaries and letters, it provides us with a look at what it must have been like to be there--how it sounded, smelled, tasted and felt. Well-written and moving at times, it provides readers with an aspect of the war that has been neglected by historians."--<em>Bowling Green Daily News</em> <br><p></p><br>"[T]his book is a vital first step in making sense of the Civil War's sensate past. It will sharpen historians' sensibilities of how combatants processed 'the smells of battle, the tastes of sieges, the traumatic pain of injury, the sights of engagement, and the sounds of strife, loss, and victory.' It will encourage historians to subject other events to similar analysis--'to turn up the volume, to make the whiffs smell, the caresses touch.'"--<em>Chronicle Review</em><p></p><br>"Historians often ask readers to imagine the intense sights, sounds, and smells of battle. Smith goes one step further and explores how such sensory assaults affect the conduct of war itself...Smith gets into these gritty details by narrating some of the most important encounters of the American Civil War: the noise of the shelling of Fort Sumter; the confusion caused by the proliferation of different uniforms and badges at the First Battle of Bull Run; the stench of death at Gettysburg, which lingered from July to October; the hunger caused by the siege of Vicksburg; and the claustrophobic conditions faced by the crew of a crude Confederate submarine."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Turning his historical eye (and ear and nose...) to the sensory experience of war provides Smith the opportunity to write more evocatively than most historians, to bring to life the individualized experience of war--the howl of the cannons, the smell of burning horses, the taste of mule meat--in ways other histories cannot."--<em>Failure Magazine</em> <br><p></p><br>"With <em>The Smell of Battle, the Taste of Siege</em> Smith braids his interest in the senses and Civil War history into a burnished gem of a book that bracingly defamiliarizes intensively worked terrain...Graceful, insightful, and forceful in its brevity, this book should earn a place as a touchstone of contemporary Civil War historiography."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Many Americans experienced their Civil War as a cacophony of exploding shells, the sight of burning buildings, the stench of rotting corpses, the taste of spoiled rations in the armies or mule meat in starving cities under siege, and the touch of unwashed bodies crowded in small spaces. A pioneer in the field of 'sensory history,' Mark Smith re-creates these unpleasant experiences as closely as possible through the medium of the printed word."--James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom</em>, winner of the Pulitzer Prize<p></p><br>"Recovering the human experience of the Civil War is difficult with even the best literary sources-which makes Mark M. Smith's exploration of the conflict's sensory landscape especially valuable. From the cramped interior of the submarine <em>Hunley</em> to the grim living conditions among the besieged population of Vicksburg, Smith brings readers into a world of sights, smells, and sounds that add texture to our understanding of the nation's transformative trauma."--Gary W. Gallagher, author of <em>The Union War</em><p></p><br>"Smith, one of the most imaginative and creative of historians of the United States and a pioneer in the History of the Senses, evokes the immediacy of war, calling forth the feelings of battle by eliciting the use of the senses. More than an eye-witness account, this book arouses the ear, the taste, the feel, and the smell of war. Smith fuses overwhelming sights as they mingle with discordant sounds, rancid tastes, foul odors, and close feel. No mere intellectual exercise, this study presents a sensory perspective on Civil War history as it was experienced and shows how the senses affect war's outcomes. Introducing the senses as forces and factors relevant to making war and to the suffering caused by battle, Smith has written a work that is an essential contribution to the study of the Civil War and to war in general."--Orville Vernon Burton, author <em>The Age of Lincoln</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Grant Writing and Fundraising Tool Kit for Human Services (Standards for Excellence)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Provides the tools for developing successful grant writing skills and fundraising plans.</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Grant Writing and Fundraising Tool Kit for Human Services</i> is a user-friendly text that will motivate even the most apprehensive student in learning to develop and implement a funding plan. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Upon completing this book readers will be able to:</p> <ul> <li> Develop and implement successful fundraising campaigns </li><li> Create and employ a wide variety of effective marketing activities </li><li> Implement, manage, and close a funded project </li><li> Apply ethical standards to developing, implementing, and evaluating fundraising activities </li><li> Understand innovative ways to recruit and motivate members of a fundraising team </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p> <b>Jill C.

In addition to the historical information and discussion of aesthetic issues that appear in the introductions to each of the chapters, the book presents English translations of otherwise inaccessible major works on Japanese aesthetics, beginning with a complete and annotated translation of the first work in the field, Nishi Amane's <i>Bimyogaku Setsu (The Theory of Aesthetics).</i><br><br>In its four sections (The Subject of Aesthetics, Aesthetic Categories, Poetic Expression, Postmodernism and Aesthetics), <i>Modern Japanese Aesthetics</i> discusses the momentous efforts made by Japanese thinkers to master, assimilate, and transform Western philosophical systems to discuss their own literary and artistic heritage. Readers are introduced to debates between the unconditional supporters of Western ideas (Onishi Hajime) and more cautious approaches to the literary and artistic past (Okakura Kakuzo, Tsubouchi Shoyo). The institutionalization of aesthetics as an academic subject is discussed and the work of some of Japan's most distinguished professional aestheticians (Onishi Yoshimori, Imamichi Tomonobu), philosophers (Kusanagi Masao, Nishitani Keiji, Sakabe Megumi), and literary critics (Karatani Kojin) is included. <i>Modern Japanese Aesthetics</i> is a sophisticated and energetic volume on the process that led to the construction of aesthetic categories used by Japanese and, later, Western scholars in discussing Japanese literature and arts.

Why do A-list movie stars make so much money? How do television networks decide what programs to air? Do video games encourage violent behavior among young people, or do they make users smarter? Does advertising really work? In <em>Mix It Up</em>, David Grazian answers these questions and introduces students to a sociological perspective of popular culture and mass media.<br><br> Based on the author&#x2019;s popular course at the University of Pennsylvania, <em>Mix it Up</em> focuses on the role of media and popular culture in everyday life, with a particular emphasis on the organization and functioning of the mass media industry; the increasingly blurry relationship between cultural consumption and production; and the social significance of leisure activities, from sports to shopping.<br><br> Whether it&#x2019;s DJ culture, YouTube videos, or mash-ups, <em>Mix It Up</em> takes an empirically driven (yet user-friendly) approach to examining media and pop culture from all corners of society. Writing in a &#x201c;non-textbook&#x201d; style, Grazian relies on a variety of theoretical perspectives and fleshes out his discussions with examples from empirical sociological studies as well as excerpts from field notes, face-to-face interviews, and other research materials collected over the last decade.<br><br></p><p>David Grazian is an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches courses on popular culture and mass media, urban sociology, and ethnographic methods.

The only B-picture to make it into the National <br>Film Registry of the Library of Congress, Detour has outrun its fate as the <br>bastard child of one of Hollywood's lowliest studios. Ulmer's film follows, in <br>flashback, the journey of Al Roberts (Tom Neal), a pianist hitching from New <br>York to California to join his girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake), a singer gone to <br>seek her fortune in Hollywood. In classic noir style, Detour features mysterious <br>deaths, changes of identity, an unforgettable femme fatale called Vera (Ann <br>Savage), and, in Roberts, a wretched, masochistic antihero. <br>Noah Isenberg's study of Detour draws on a vast array of archival sources, <br>unpublished letters and interviews, to provide an animated and thorough <br>account of the film's production history, its critical reception, its afterlife <br>(including various remakes) and the different ways in which the film has been <br>understood since its release.

However, during our consulting and teaching engagements, we have encountered many ill-equipped organizations as well. We observed some common factors among them, which we address in this book:<br> </p><ul> <li>Lack of understanding of the complexity of BI decision-support projects</li><li>Lack of recognizing BI decision-support projects as cross-organizational business initiatives and not understanding that cross-organizational initiatives are different from stand-alone solutions</li><li>Unavailable or unwilling business representatives</li><li>Unengaged business sponsors or business sponsors who have little or no authority due to their low-level positions within the organization </li><li>Lack of skilled and available staff as well as suboptimum staff utilization</li><li>Inappropriate project team structure and dynamics</li><li>No software release concept (no iterative development method)</li><li>No work breakdown structure (no methodology)</li><li>Ineffective project management (only project administration)</li><li>No business analysis and no standardization activities</li><li>No appreciation of the impact of dirty data on business profitability</li><li>No understanding of the necessity for and the usage of meta data</li><li>Too much reliance on disparate methods and tools (the &#x201c;silver bullet&#x201d; syndrome)</li></ul> <p></p> <p>BI project managers and project teams can use this book to improve their project life cycles. They can also use it to obtain the appropriate recognition for their BI projects from the business community and to solicit the required support from their executive management. BI project team members and the business representatives assigned to them can use this book to gain a better understanding of the development effort required to build and deploy successful BI decision-support applications.</p> <p><b>THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK</b></p> <i>Business Intelligence Roadmap</i> is a guide for developing BI decision-support applications. The two main purposes of this book are to <ol> <li>Explain the complexity of BI decision-support projects</li> <li>Present a step-by-step guide for the entire BI project lifecycle</li> </ol> <b>Complexity</b> <p>In order to give you an appreciation of the complexity of BI decision-support projects, we describe all of the components that go into a BI decision- support development effort. For example:<br> </p><ul> <li>You should know what makes a BI decision-support application different from a traditional decision-support system so that you can avoid costly mistakes.</li><li>You should understand the infrastructure components of your new BI decision-support application, such as the tools available (for development and for access and analysis).</li><li>You should be able to recognize items that could impair the success of your new BI decision-support application.</li><li>You should determine how many resources you need and what type of resources, both technical and human.</li><li>You should decide on the design or architecture of your BI decision- support application, such as designing for multidimensional reporting or ad hoc querying.</li></ul> <p></p> <br> <b>Step-by-Step Guide</b> <p>Our step-by-step guide across the breadth of a complete development lifecycle includes activities, deliverables, roles and responsibilities, dos and don&#x2019;ts, and entry and exit criteria, plus tips and rules of thumb to lead you to a successful BI decision-support implementation. For example:<br> </p><ul> <li>You should choose which steps you ought to perform on your BI project because no two BI decision-support projects are exactly alike.</li><li>You should know whether to start with a cross-organizational decision-support solution or a tailored departmental solution with the basis for expansion.</li><li>You should understand the sequence in which to perform development activities, that is, which ones can be performed in parallel tracks and which ones have a strong dependency on one another. </li></ul> <p></p> <p>In contrast to topic-specific materials available on BI, this book is a <i>single-source development guide</i> written specifically for BI decision-support applications. The guidelines presented in this book are based not only on our personal experiences but also on some of the best practices covered in topic-specific books, articles, and Web sites.</p> <p><b>HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED</b></p> <p>All software development projects are complicated engineering projects, as demonstrated by the breadth of topics covered in this book. Chapter 0, Guide to the Development Steps, explains the general organization of the development guidelines in <i>Business Intelligence Roadmap.</i> </p> <p>This book is organized into two major parts. Part I, Stages and Steps, describes the 16 development steps, which are introduced in Chapter 0. Part I gives you a broad understanding of the development effort involved in BI decision-support projects. Part II, At a Glance, supplements the text contained in the first part of the book with several matrices that should be used together as a reference guide for all BI decision-support projects.</p> <b>Part I: Stages and Steps</b> <p>Part I begins with Chapter 0, Guide to the Development Steps, and is followed by 16 development chapters. Each of the 16 development chapters is dedicated to one unique development step and describes the effort required to perform the activities of that step. </p> <p>Guide to the Development Steps (Chapter 0) describes the general layout of the development guidelines presented in this book, contrasting those guidelines with a traditional development methodology. It discusses the six engineering stages as well as the three parallel development tracks, and it groups the applicable development steps under both. Chapter 0 explains the application release concept and shows how to organize a BI project with the appropriate roles and responsibilities for the core team and the extended team.</p> <p>Each of the <i>development steps</i> (Chapters 1-16) begins with an individual chapter overview followed by a section called Things to Consider. These are general questions BI project teams usually contemplate when deciding which activities need to be performed under each development step. These questions are merely presented as &#x201c;food for thought&#x201d; and are not necessarily explored in the chapters; nor are they all-inclusive. Each chapter discusses the main topics applicable to the development step covered by that chapter. Some topics apply to more than one development step, such as testing or product evaluation. However, to avoid redundancy these common topics are covered in only one chapter and are only briefly referenced in the other chapters.</p> <p>Each of the 16 chapters contains a list of major activities for that development step, accompanied by a figure showing what activities could be performed concurrently. The list of activities is followed by descriptions of the deliverables resulting from these activities and the roles involved in performing these activities. Each chapter concludes with a brief discussion of risks to weigh in case you decide not to perform that step on your project. Do not interpret the risks of not performing the step to mean that every BI project team must perform every development step exactly as suggested. Instead, use the risk section to determine whether the activities in that development step are&#x2014;or should be&#x2014;mandatory on your project. If they are not, you may decide not to perform some or all of those activities after discussing the risks with the business sponsor.</p> <br> <b>Part II: At a Glance</b> <p>Part II contains the following matrices.<br> </p><ul> <li> <i>The Human Resource Allocation Matrix </i>(Chapter 17) lists all the vital roles involved in performing the step activities, tasks, and subtasks. The roles listed in this matrix need to be assigned to project team members. In order to help you discover and avoid potential resource allocation problems, the steps that can be performed in parallel and their appropriate roles are listed together.<br> <br> </li><li> <i>The Entry &amp; Exit Criteria and Deliverables Matrix</i> (Chapter 18) indicates the prerequisites, results, and deliverables for each development step. Not every BI project team will need to perform all activities for all development steps. This matrix should help you determine whether you can skip a step or incorporate some of its activities into other steps.<br> <br> </li><li> <i>The Activity Dependency Matrix</i> (Chapter 19) is a collection of activity dependency charts for the development steps. This matrix shows at a glance which activities in each step can be performed concurrently. It should be used to determine workflow and task assignments for project team members.<br> <br> </li><li> <i>The Task/Subtask Matrix</i> (Chapter 20) itemizes all pertinent tasks, and in some cases subtasks, for all the major activities under each step. This matrix should be used to prepare the work breakdown structure for the project plan. You can customize (expand or reduce) the tasks and subtasks on an as-needed basis for individual projects.<br> <br> </li><li> <i>The Practical Guidelines Matrix</i> (Chapter 21) presents three subsections for each development step: Dos, Don&#x2019;ts, and Tips and Rules of Thumb. Dos point out best practices for the development steps, and Don&#x2019;ts instruct you how to avoid traps and pitfalls. Tips and Rules of Thumb are our personal collection of experiences over several decades of developing cross-organizational decision-support applications.<br> <br> </li></ul> <p></p> <p><b>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</b></p> We suggest that all core members of the BI project team make use of this book as follows.<ol> <li>First, read all the chapters in Part I to gain an overall understanding of all the components of BI decision-support development. </li> <li>Next, compare your own BI project scope and requirements to the topics in the book. Use the discussions in the chapters to decide which specific development steps apply to your project. </li> <li>Go to Chapter 18 and look up the entry and exit criteria for the steps you selected. Be sure that you have the prerequisites to implement your development approach and that you have a clear understanding of what it takes to move forward.</li> <li>Put your project plan together for the steps you have chosen by consulting the activity dependency flow charts in Chapter 19 and by using the tasks and subtasks listed in Chapter 20. To kick-start your project, you may want to copy and customize the work breakdown structure provided on the CD included with this book to fit your needs. The work breakdown structure on the CD is a Microsoft Project file that already includes the step dependencies (shown in Figure 0.6 in Chapter 0) and the activity dependencies (shown in the flow charts in Chapter 19). In addition, the work breakdown structure contains some basic mandatory task dependencies.</li> <li>Use the matrices in Part II as a quick reference to help guide your development work throughout the project.</li> </ol> <p><b>WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK</b></p> <p>Segments of this book should be read and referenced by every member of the BI project team, including business representatives. It is important that <i>all</i> project participants understand &#x201c;the big picture&#x201d; and how they and their roles fit into it. This also applies to third-party consultants, who can fill any technical role on the project team. Understanding this larger view of the project and its development effort is essential in maintaining a level of enthusiasm and cooperation necessary for the team. Below we spotlight team members&#x2019; roles and provide lists of the most useful and applicable chapters for each specific role. </p> <b>Business Representatives</b> <p>Although the development steps are technical in nature, business representatives involved in BI projects must understand what activities need to occur during the development effort. Business representatives are expected to participate as full-time members of the project core teams, and some of the activities described in this book will be assigned to them.

As the sons and daughters of Soviet citizens considered by the regime to be dangerous to the political order, these children lost parents, siblings, homes, educational and work opportunities, and, in many cases, their physical health. From 2005 to 2007, Cathy A.

They speak openly about coping with starvation, disease, forced labor, and anti-Semitism, and about living in exile in remote Soviet villages as children of &#x201c;enemies of the people.&#x201d; Finally, they discuss how their opinion of the Soviet government was influenced by their experiences and how it has evolved over time. The result is a unique oral history, illustrated with photographs and maps of each child&#x2019;s multiple displacements, that will profoundly deepen the reader&#x2019;s understanding of life in the U.S.S.R. under the rule of Joseph Stalin.</p><p>In this powerful and moving oral history, ten now-grown survivors of political repression in the Soviet Union during the reign of Joseph Stalin share their personal stories of childhood banishment, starvation, abuse, and endurance.<b>Cathy A.

CIA analyst Steven R. Ward shows that Iran's soldiers, from the famed "Immortals" of ancient Persia to today's Revolutionary Guard, have demonstrated through the centuries that they should not be underestimated. This history also provides background on the nationalist, tribal, and religious heritages of the country to help readers better understand Iran and its security outlook.<br><br><i>Immortal</i> begins with the founding of ancient Persia's empire under Cyrus the Great and continues through the Iran-Iraq War (1980&#x2013;1988) and up to the present. Drawing on a wide range of sources including declassified documents, the author gives primary focus to the modern era to relate the build-up of the military under the last Shah, its collapse during the Islamic revolution, its fortunes in the Iran-Iraq War, and its rise from the ashes to help Iran become once again a major regional military power. He shows that, despite command and supply problems, Iranian soldiers demonstrate high levels of bravery and perseverance and have enjoyed surprising tactical successes even when victory has been elusive. These qualities and the Iranians' ability to impose high costs on their enemies by exploiting Iran's imposing geography bear careful consideration today by potential opponents.</p><p><b>Steven R.

Beginning with the denomination's roots in 16th-century England, this book offers a fresh account of the Episcopal Church's rise to prominence in America. Chronologically arranged, it follows the establishment of colonial Anglicanism in the New World, the national organization of the denomination following the Revolution, its rise during the 19th century, and the complex array of forces that affected the church in the 20th century&#x2015;and continue to affect it today.

Twenty years previously, Darfur was also the site of a disastrous famine. <em>Famine that Kills</em> is a seminal account of that famine, and a social history of the region. In a new preface prepared for this revised edition, Alex de Waal analyzes the roots of the current conflict in land disputes, social disruption and impoverishment. Despite vast changes in the nature of famines and in the capacity of response, de Waal's original challenge to humanitarian theory and practice including a focus on the survival strategies of rural people has never been more relevant. Documenting the resilience of the people who suffered, it explains why many fewer died than had been predicted by outsiders. It is also a pathbreaking study of the causes of famine deaths, showing how outbreaks of infectious disease killed more people than starvation.

It's my clamber-and-tumble-and-beech-and-bramble hill! Sometimes, when I'm standing on the top, I fill my lungs with air and I shout. I shout."</i><p> As <i>The Seeing Stone</i> opens, exuberant young Arthur has no idea what adventure lies ahead. A 13-year-old growing up in 12th-century England, Arthur soon discovers that his life parallels that of another Arthur, son of Uther centuries past, the legendary boy king "who was and will be." The second son of Sir John de Caldicot, lord of a manor near the Welsh border, Arthur narrates his everyday life in the Marchland in 100 clipped chapters of crisp, melodic prose. But his destiny entwined with that other, ancient Arthur is revealed only in snatches, after he receives (courtesy of our old friend Merlin) a piece of obsidian, a seeing stone, through which a well-woven story within a story unfolds.</p><p> But rather than the fantasy of T.H. White's <i>The Sword in the Stone</i>, Kevin Crossley-Holland offers a convincing and meticulously researched account of what life might have actually been like for a curious, capable, earnest young man in this peculiar time and place, with all its customs, rituals, and regimented routine and social structure. In a well-paced story that alternates between drama, comedy, and even a little mystery, Arthur tackles some surprisingly sophisticated topics, whether he's questioning the pompous priest Oliver (is the poverty on the manor truly part of God's will?), pestering his father over his plans for him (will he become a squire, as he wishes, or a monk or priest or school man?), or just contemplating his place in the scheme of things under the blue sky atop Tumber Hill. <i>The Seeing Stone</i> is a fun, involving read for kids, but will hold grownup attentions, too, with its flowing language, dense period detail, and all the questions that it asks--and doesn't always answer.

Highly recommended." - CHOICE</p> <p>"There is little if any systematic work on the intersection between art history and disability studies. When a theory is broached, it usually comes down to the accusation that art has participated in the history of discrimination against disabled people. Millett-Gallant is able to discuss troubling aspects concerning disability in the history of art, and yet she finds a way to describe how these same troubling aspects resist discrimination. Hers is a complex idea of aesthetic representation, and her analysis does not fail to respect this complexity but, rather, dwells in it by providing a dense articulation of works of art, their allusions, and meanings. The book is of critical importance. It is the first of its kind." - Tobin Siebers, University of Michigan</p> <p>"An important contribution to the growing field of disability studies, Millett-Gallant brings art history into contact and collaboration with the perspectives of disabled models, artists, and critics. A must-read for everybody who is interested in cultural representations of disability." - Petra Kuppers, University of Michigan and author of The Scar of Visibility: Medical Performances and Contemporary Art</p> <p>"Millett-Gallant's book addresses a significant gap in both art history and disability studies through her thoughtful analysis of contemporary art that engages the extraordinary body. That enterprise is groundbreaking for both fields, in part because there exists no other study of this kind, but also because Millett-Gallant refuses to adapt an interpretive method that reinforces binaries, importantly pointing out that hierarchical divides such as disabled/nondisabled (when considering artists) and liberating/derogatory (when considering art) can effectively limit understanding the subversive potential of disability's presence in contemporary art. Rather, her assertion that its reconsideration must of necessity be dialogic effectively demonstrates the peculiar power disability has across multiple genres of visual representation, including photography, sculpture, painting, and performance art. For Millett-Gallant, these images resist categorization; recall and respond to their own lineage in medical and popular representation; and recast the disabled body anew in social performance. Calling on her reader to resist an interpretive paternalism, she curates a fascinating and first of its kind exhibition within the pages of this book." - Ann M.

Yet our understanding of this tragic episode remains superficial because, then and now, we have never grasped the passionate commitment with which the Vietnamese clung to and fought over their own competing visions of what Vietnam was and what it might become. To understand the war, we must understand the Vietnamese, their culture, and their ways of looking at the world. Neil L. Jamieson, after many years of living and working in Vietnam, has written the book that provides this understanding.<br><br>Jamieson paints a portrait of twentieth-century Vietnam. Against the background of traditional Vietnamese culture, he takes us through the saga of modern Vietnamese history and Western involvement in the country, from the coming of the French in 1858 through the Vietnam War and its aftermath. Throughout his analysis, he allows the Vietnamese&#x2015;both our friends and foes, and those who wished to be neither&#x2015;to speak for themselves through poetry, fiction, essays, newspaper editorials and reports of interviews and personal experiences.<br><br>By putting our old and partial perceptions into this new and broader context, Jamieson provides positive insights that may perhaps ease the lingering pain and doubt resulting from our involvement in Vietnam. As the United States and Vietnam appear poised to embark on a new phase in their relationship, Jamieson's book is particularly timely.</p><p>To better understand ourselves, we must understand the Vietnam War. We must learn more about Vietnamese culture and Vietnamese paradigms in order to untangle the muddled debates about our own. Realizing that we must do this is the first and most important lesson of Vietnam. And it is one we Americans have been exasperatingly slow to learn. We remain far too ready to assume that other people are, or want to be, or should be, like us.<b>Neil L.

It follows that the roasting or cooking of meat was a political act, as the division of portions asserted a social order. And the only proper manner of preparing meat for consumption, according to the Greeks, was blood sacrifice.<br> <br> The fundamental myth is that of Prometheus, who introduced sacrifice and, in the process, both joined us to and separated us from the gods&#x2014;and ambiguous relation that recurs in marriage and in the growing of grain. Thus we can understand why the ascetic man refuses both women and meat, and why Greek women celebrated the festival of grain-giving Demeter with instruments of butchery.<br> <br> The ambiguity coded in the consumption of meat generated a mythology of the "other"&#x2014;werewolves, Scythians, Ethiopians, and other "monsters." The study of the sacrificial consumption of meat thus leads into exotic territory and to unexpected findings.<br> <br> In <i>The Cuisine of Sacrifice</i>, the contributors&#x2014;all scholars affiliated with the Center for Comparative Studies of Ancient Societies in Paris&#x2014;apply methods from structural anthropology, comparative religion, and philology to a diversity of topics: the relation of political power to sacrificial practice; the Promethean myth as the foundation story of sacrificial practice; representations of sacrifice found on Greek vases; the technique and anatomy of sacrifice; the interaction of image, language, and ritual; the position of women in sacrificial custom and the female ritual of the <i>Thesmophoria</i>; the mythical status of wolves in Greece and their relation to the sacrifice of domesticated animals; the role and significance of food-related ritual in Homer and Hesiod; ancient Greek perceptions of Scythian sacrificial rites; and remnants of sacrificial ritual in modern Greek practices.</p></p><p>For the Greeks, the sharing of cooked meats was the fundamental communal act, so that to become vegetarian was a way of refusing civil society.

For reasons unknown, after nearly six centuries of continuous habitation, the village was abandoned around 2600 BC and its stone structures covered over--perhaps deliberately, like the structures at Gobekli Tepe. Although now well-excavated, very little is known about the peaceful people who lived at Skara Brae or their origins. Who were they and where did they go?<br><br>Drawing on his in-depth knowledge of the connections between the cosmology and linguistics of Egyptian, Dogon, Chinese, and Vedic traditions, Laird Scranton reveals the striking similarities between Skara Brae and the Dogon of Mali, who still practice the same cosmology and traditions they once shared with pre-dynastic Egypt. He shows how the earliest Skara Brae houses match the typical Dogon stone house as well as Schwaller de Lubicz&#x2019;s intrepretation of the Egyptian Temple of Man at Luxor. He explains how megalithic stone sites near Skara Brae conform to Dogon cosmology, each representing sequential stages of creation as described by Dogon priests, and he details how the houses at Skara Brae also represent a concept of creation. Citing a linguistic phenomenon known as &#x201c;ultraconserved words,&#x201d; the author compares words of the Faroese language at Skara Brae, a language with no known origin, with important cosmological words from Dogon and ancient Egyptian traditions, finding obvious connections and similarities. <br><br>Scranton shows how the cultivated field alongside the village of Skara Brae corresponds to the &#x201c;heavenly field&#x201d; symbolism pervasive throughout many ancient cultures, such as the Field of Reeds of the ancient Egyptians and the Elysian Fields of ancient Greece. He demonstrates how Greek and Egyptian geographic descriptions of these fields are a consistent match with Orkney Island. Examining the similarities between Skara Brae and Gobekli Tepe, Scranton reveals that Skara Brae may have been a secondary center of initiation and civilizing knowledge, a long-lost Egyptian mystery school set up millennia after Gobekli Tepe was ritually buried, and given the timing of the site, is possibly the source of the first pharaohs and priests of ancient Egypt.</p><p>Laird Scranton is the author of a series of books on ancient cosmology and language, including <i>The Science of the Dogon</i>, <i>Point of Origin</i>, and <i>China&#x2019;s Cosmological Prehistory</i>.

Among them were Theodor Schwann, who demonstrated that all animals are made of cells; Hermann Helmholtz, who measured the velocity of nerve impulses; and Rudolf Virchow, who convinced doctors to think of disease at the cellular level.

[This] work of authoritative and authentic scholarship ... will establish the bench mark for Weber translations in the social sciences." <i>Bryan S. Turner, University of Cambridge</i> <br> <p>"I am glad to see this immensely important work, first published a century ago, finally made available to the English reading public in an accessible version ... Kalberg succeeds in making the text a pleasure to read." <i>Egon Bittner, Brandeis University</i><br> </p> <p>"Weber&#x2032;s classic text has now at last been given the treatment it deserves in English, with Stephen Kalberg&#x2032;s meticulous translation and superb editorial presentation." <i>William Outhwaite, University of Sussex</i><br> </p> <p>"This new translation offers a readable, trenchant alternative to the ideologies of modernity and to the postmodernist philosophies central to much social theory, ethics and theology today. Those interested in the future will attend to this fresh recovery of the past." <i>Max L. Stackhouse, Princeton Theological Seminary</i><br> </p> <p>"Stephen Kalberg has produced a book that teachers and students will find invaluable. What an excellent idea, to combine a new translation of Max Weber&#x2032;s <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> with other closely related writings of Weber&#x2032;s, including a detailed and accessible introduction and supporting background information on Weber the man, on the book, and on its place in contemporary social science. Kalberg&#x2032;s comprehensive introduction manages to be informative and scholarly while remaining a clear and intelligible guide to the book. The introduction offers an accurate and refined statement of Weber&#x2032;s important and influential (if often misunderstood) thesis, placing it in the context of its era and to Weber&#x2032;s general idea of sociology. This new version of The Protestant Ethic should greatly improve upon its predecessor and clear up misunderstandings of Weber&#x2032;s meaning which the earlier translation may have engendered." <i>Wes Sharrock, University of Manchester</i><br> </p> <p>"This new translation of Weber&#x2032;s <i>The Protestant Ethic</i>, one of the most important social science works of the twentieth century, is a welcome and worthwhile enterprise. It carefully presents the numerous and important nuances of Weber&#x2032;s text, giving a clear idea of the place of this text in the intellectual framework of his time. Professor Kalberg&#x2032;s introduction provides a very interesting commentary on this text as well as the place of Weber&#x2032;s work in the history of sociology and its relevance to the central problems of contemporary sociology theory. [The book] is a distinct contribution &#x2013; and a tool for students of sociological theory and its history." <i>S.N. Eisenstadt, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</i><br> </p> <p>"A couple of years ago I had to re&#x2013;read Plato&#x2032;s <i>Republic</i>. I was amazed by the striking resemblance between the social problems addressed by Plato and the problems of contemporary societies. I had similar experience after reading the new translation of <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> by Stephen Kalberg, an internationally acclaimed Weberian scholar. Although capitalism and the discursive formation that has laid the foundation for its existence has changed very much, reading this classical work of Weber reminds one the nature and operations of capitalism that we take for granted...[Kalberg] has successfully overcome the daunting task of balancing between keeping Weber&#x2032;s message intact while at the same time providing a reader friendly translation." <i>AlemSeghed Kebede, California State University, Bakersfield</i><br> </p> <p>"Essentially, Kalberg achieves his goal of providing an indispensable, up&#x2013;to&#x2013;date resource for the scholar, teacher, student while, at the same time presenting the general, albeit serious reader with an engaging version of this most outstanding of Weber&#x2032;s works. <i>Auto/Biography Journal</i></p>First published in 1905, <i>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</i> is one of the most renowned and controversial works of modern social science. It is a brilliant book that studies the psychological conditions which made possible the development of capitalist civilisation. The book analyses the connection between the spread of Calvinism and a new attitude towards the pursuit of wealth in post&#x2013;Reformation Europe and England, and attitude which permitted, encouraged even sanctified the human quest for prosperity. <br> <p>This new edition has been translated and introduced by internationally acclaimed Weberian scholar Stephen Kalberg. With a precise and nuanced rendering of Weber&#x2032;s style and arguments, Kalberg clarifies the various twists and turns of Weber&#x2032;s complex lines of reasoning. Kalberg&#x2032;s introduction examines the controversy surrounding the book and summarizes major aspects of Weber&#x2032;s analysis.

Danto traces the evolution of the pop artist, including his early reception, relationships with artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, and the Factory phenomenon. He offers close readings of individual Warhol works, including their social context and philosophical dimensions, key differences with predecessors such as Marcel Duchamp, and parallels with successors like Jeff Koons. Danto brings to bear encyclopedic knowledge of Warhol&#x2019;s time and&nbsp;shows us Warhol as an endlessly multidimensional figure&#x2014;artist, political activist, filmmaker, writer, philosopher&#x2014;who retains permanent&nbsp;residence in our national imagination.</p><p>Danto suggests that "what makes him an American icon is that his subject matter is always something that the ordinary American understands: everything, or nearly everything he made art out of came straight out of the daily lives of very ordinary Americans. . . . The tastes and values of ordinary persons all at once were inseparable from advanced art."</p></p><p><b>Arthur C. Danto</b> was Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation. </i>He was the author of numerous books, including <i>Unnatural Wonders: Essays from the Gap Between Art and Life</i>, <i>After the End of Art</i>, and <i>Beyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective.</i>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Fred Kaplan Two decades after his death, Andy Warhol remains the biggest-selling artist of our time and the most famous -- the only one whose name, face and style are recognizable even by people who know nothing else about art. Why is a bit of a mystery. Warhol rose to glory in the early '60s among a handful of artists rebelling against Abstract Expressionism and creating a new kind of American art that in some cases celebrated images from mass consumer culture. Among these artists -- Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist -- Warhol was the last to emerge and arguably the least talented craftsman. Yet it was Warhol who came to define the era. His breakthrough canvases -- silkscreen paintings of Marilyn Monroe, Campbell's Soup cans and grisly car crashes -- are not only museum centerpieces but modern icons. How this pale, shy (but also calculating and ambitious) boy from Pittsburgh became "the artist of the second half of the 20th century" -- as critic Arthur C. Danto describes him -- is a puzzle that two new books try to solve, with uneven success. Danto is the author of the slim, meditative "Andy Warhol." The art critic for the Nation and a philosophy professor at Columbia, he has been struggling with this question since 1964, when he attended Warhol's show of Brillo Boxes at the Stable Gallery. The boxes were made of wood, not cardboard; and the logo was silkscreened, not machine-stamped. But otherwise, they looked exactly like the shipping containers of Brillo soap pads in every American supermarket. The "challenge," Danto writes, "was to explain why Warhol's box was art while its look-alike in common life was not." He concludes that there is no explanation and that, therefore, Warhol ruptured all of art history. He goes too far here. A half-century earlier, after all, Marcel Duchamp had displayed a urinal and an upside-down bicycle wheel as works of art. Danto notes that those "readymades," as Duchamp called them, were objects already in existence, whereas Warhol created the Brillo Boxes to look like readymades. But this doesn't necessarily make Warhol more revolutionary than Duchamp; in fact, given that Danto describes Warhol's boxes as "beautiful," they might be less defiant. In this sense, Warhol and the other Pop artists -- all influenced by Duchamp -- were reviving an artistic tradition from an earlier rebellious era. Still, Danto's larger points about Warhol's impact are indisputable, and he traces its lineage to a moment in 1961 when Warhol made two paintings of Coke bottles -- one with Abstract Expressionist drippings, the other without -- and chose the latter as the template for his subsequent work. "It was a mandate and a breakthrough," Danto writes. "The mandate was: paint what we are. The breakthrough was the insight into what we are. We are the kind of people that are looking for the kind of happiness advertisements promise us that we can have, easily and cheaply." Danto calls the subsequent era "the Age of Warhol" because of this blending of high art and commercial art -- of art and life broadly. Tony Scherman and David Dalton, in their Warhol biography "Pop," underscore "the Pop insight that a great part of our experience now comes to us not directly but through a photographic, mass media veil." Pop art and early '60s rock music grew out of this same aesthetic of "cleansing away all the traditional prevailing sensibilities in the arts," leaving a broad "openness to possibilities." This link explains why, even before he recruited Lou Reed and formed the Velvet Underground, Warhol was hailed as a superstar by young rock fans, though he was as old as their parents. Scherman, a music writer, and Dalton, an art writer who briefly worked as an assistant to Warhol, entertainingly trace the artist's rise from a sickly, poor art student to a wealthy, prize-winning Manhattan advertising designer to the most unlikely avant-garde painter of all time. They're less clear, and sometimes contradictory, on why Warhol emerged as the decisive figure. They persuasively refute the notion that he was a "primitive," noting his deep knowledge of the art world. But on a single page, they claim both that Warhol "genuinely" admired the commercial products that he painted and that he found them "goofy and inane." They start the book with a moment in August 1960 when Warhol supposedly transformed himself from a commercial artist into a gallery artist; but they later note that he kept doing commercial work throughout his career. In fact, Warhol's conceptual novelty lay in seeing commercial and high art as seamless. The authors draw a thick dividing line at June 1968, when Warhol was shot and nearly killed by the delusional Valerie Solanas. They argue that his art was rebellious and innovative before, corporate and lazy after. Certainly the attack made him more cautious, but they overstate the point. First, as they observe, Warhol's art had declined a year before the shooting, especially with his senseless movies (to which they give way too much space). Second, many of Warhol's post-'68 works -- his Mao portraits, skull paintings and several of the commissioned portraits (which the authors unjustly dismiss as hack work) -- are adventurous and gorgeous: his familiarly plaintive style fused with painterly flourishes reminiscent of de Kooning. They're not the breakthroughs of his early-'60s works, but they fit -- and guided -- the postmodern pluralism of the '70s and '80s. He remained a trailblazer of his era. Did Warhol grasp the profundity of his innovations, or was he as vapid as his pose made him seem? Danto writes that Warhol had "a philosophical mind" -- a dubious claim: If he ever discussed ideas seriously, the evidence has yet to be revealed. A more plausible perspective comes from an article by critic Peter Schjeldahl, from which Scherman and Dalton quote at length. Some artists at the time did mull the issues that Pop art raised. "I don't see him doing that," Schjeldahl wrote of Warhol. "That's why we reach for the word 'genius' . . . He sees clearly. He just does it." <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

LeSueur has worked as a historian for the Religious Studies Center at Brigham Young University and is currently a Graduate Teaching Fellow in the Department of Economics at the University of Utah.</p><p> "From Danite oaths to extermination orders, this book succinctly reveals what really happened between the Mormons and the Missourians.

This work is unquestionably the best book written on the subject."--Western Historical Quarterly</p><br><br><p>"As a result of thoroughgoing research and the meticulous use of sources, LeSueur has written a well-documented account of the Mormon War in Missouri that is, as a history should be, both engrossing and educational. Although many of the tragic occurrences he describes are not new to historians of the conflict, the author provides a broader and deeper understanding of the series of events than hitherto available."--Journal of the Early Republic</p><br><br><p>"Eminently readable and meticulously researched, The 1838 Mormon War in Missouri combines first-rate scholarship with a vigorous prose too often lacking in historical writing."--Quarterly West</p><br><br><p>"This is a thoughtful and well-documented study of an aspect of American history that has often been obscured by partisanship. . . .

Storyboarding is the process of graphically organizing a project--a motion picture, animation, motion graphic, or interactive media sequence--in order to translate artists&#39; ideas from story to screen. Whether you&#39;re a filmmaker, animator, ad director, writer, or video-game artist--storyboarding is a skill that is absolutely critical. Storyboarding Essentials covers everything students and working professionals need to master the art of writing and formatting scripts, creating frames, and following visual logic to create a cohesive narrative.</p><p>BENJAMIN REID PHILLIPS has been teaching drawing, storyboarding, and sequential art courses at SCAD since 2004. He is also a sequential artist and illustrator whose work has been featured in the Cartoon Art Museum's Monsters of Webcomics series.

He has also written Savannah Tavern Tales and Pub Review and Savannah Ghosts: Haunts of the Hostess City, illustrated by Julie Collins.Regardless of genre or discipline, storyboards share a language that reflects the jargon and terminology employed by industries born out of the filmed visual narrative. They connect written word to final cut; they concern themselves with what the camera &#x201c;sees&#x201d; (framing height, camera angle, and movement); they use standard and recognized formats (aspect ratios); and they even employ similar organizational systems (numbering). While the cinematographer relies on instinct and experience, a good storyboard artist will develop a strong understanding of camera angles and framing heights to help the director achieve his or her vision.</p><h2>Charleston in My Time: The Paintings of West Fraser</h2><p>One of the most important painters in Charleston shares his vision of the great city in 215 color plates depicting the great landmarks and buildings of this historic locale.</p><p>West Fraser was born in Savannah, Georgia, but was raised mainly in South Carolina, on Hilton Head Island.

Sailors referred to it as "Las Encantadas"- the enchanted islands. Lying in the eastern Pacific Ocean, straddling the equator off the west coast of South America, the Gal�pagos is the most pristine archipelago to be found anywhere in the tropics. It is so remote, so untouched, that the act of wading ashore can make you feel like you are the first to do so.<br><br>Yet the Gal�pagos is far more than a wild paradise on earth-it is one of the most important sites in the history of science. Home to over 4,000 species native to its shores, around 40 percent of them endemic, the islands have often been called a "laboratory of evolution." The finches collected on the Gal�pagos inspired Darwin's revolutionary theory of natural selection.<br><br>In <i>The Gal�pagos</i>, science writer Henry Nicholls offers a lively natural and human history of the archipelago, charting its course from deserted wilderness to biological testing ground and global ecotourism hot spot. Describing the island chain's fiery geological origins as well as our species' long history of interaction with the islands, he draws vivid portraits of the life forms found in the Gal�pagos, capturing its awe-inspiring landscapes, understated flora, and stunning wildlife. Nicholls also reveals the immense challenges facing the islands, which must continually balance conservation and everencroaching development.<br><br>Beautifully weaving together natural history, evolutionary theory, and his own experience on the islands, Nicholls shows that the story of the Gal�pagos is not merely an isolated concern, but reflects the future of our species' relationship with nature-and the fate of our planet.<br></p><p><b>Henry Nicholls</b> is the author of <i>Lonesome George</i>, which was shortlisted for the 2007 Royal Society Book Prize, and <i>The Way of the Panda</i>.

As the title suggests, <i>Plato and Aristotle</i> is principally devoted to the work of the two great thinkers who represent the high point of philosophic inquiry among the Greeks.</p><p>Through an absorbing analysis of the Platonic and Aristotelian vision of soul, polis, and cosmos, Voegelin demonstrates how the symbolic framework of the older myth was superseded by the more precisely differentiated symbols of philosophy. Although this outmoding and rejection of past symbols of truth might seem to lead to a chaotic and despairing relativism, Voegelin makes it the basis of a profound conception of the historical process: "the attempts to find the symbolic forms that will adequately express the meaning [of a society], while imperfect, do not form a senseless series of failures. For the great societies have created a sequence of orders, intelligibly connected with one another as advances toward, or recessions from, an adequate symbolization of the truth concerning the order of being of which the order of society is a part."</p><p>In this view, history has no obvious "meaning," yet each society makes a similar venture after truth. Although every society works out its destiny under different conditions, each nonetheless creates symbols"in its deeds and institutions"which bear the meaning of its own existence. History, then, acquires a unity in the common endeavor toward meaning and order. The rationality and nobility of this view of history has much to say to the present age.</p><p>Dante Germino's powerful introduction to this edition of <i>Plato and Aristotle</i> eloquently directs the reader into Voegelin's search through the thought of Plato foremost and Aristotle secondarily and toward a full understanding of their relevance to the "modern" world. This masterpiece, Germino argues, provides a welcome antidote to the spirit of an era Voegelin once called the Gnostic age.</p></p><p>About the Author<p>Eric Voegelin (1901-1985) was one of the most original and influential philosophers of our time. Born in Cologne, Germany, he studied at the University of Vienna, where he became a professor of political science in the Faculty of Law. In 1938, he and his wife, fleeing Hitler, emigrated to the United States. They became American citizens in 1944. Voegelin spent much of his career at Louisiana State University, the University of Munich, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. During his lifetime he published many books and more than one hundred articles. <i>The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin</i> will make available in a uniform edition all of Voegelin's major writings.</p>About the Editor<p>Dante Germino is Professor Emeritus of Government and Foreign Affairs at the University of Virginia.

It continues to take a balanced approach to assessment, involving both traditional and innovative techniques. It includes the development and use of written tests, informal assessments, portfolios, and performance assessments. This balanced approach to assessment is what prospective teachers need when they get into the classroom. <b></b> Coverage includes integrating assessments into the learning process, showing the implications of research in cognitive psychology and showing how classroom assessments can facilitate transfer of learning and development of problem solving skills. <b></b> For professionals in the field of Educational Psychology or anyone interested in teaching methods. </p></p><p>This inexpensive short paperback focuses on teacher development and use of a wide range of assessments. In Developing and Using Classroom Assessments, Oosterhof provides both prospective and practicing teachers with a thorough, balanced integration of theoretical principles and hands-on experiences of assessment techniques that are relevant to today&#39;s classroom.<p> This book and the accompanying Web site provide a significant but succinct discussion of the development and use of classroom assessments. The book is designed for college courses and other settings for which a full survey textbook is inappropriate in terms of coverage and cost. <i>Developing and Using Classroom Assessments</i> is particularly appropriate in the following settings: </p> <ul> <li>An educational psychology course that includes a substantive discussion of assessment</li> <li>An integrated methods course in which assessment is taught as one of several components</li> <li>A full-length assessment course that uses a series of readings or involves the class in extensive field experience</li> <li>Self-study by school teachers and post-secondary instructors</li> </ul> <p><b>FEATURES OP THIS BOOK</b></p> <p> This book engages the reader. To illustrate, take time to page through the book and you will find numerous queries embedded in the text. Each is labeled "Apply What You Are Learning" and invites the reader to immediately apply recently learned concepts to realistic situations. Subsequent text often builds on these queries. This book also engages readers by drawing upon the considerable experience each of us has had with assessments as students and teachers. The introduction to each chapter uses familiar situations to establish relevance for issues to be addressed. Each chapter concludes with activities that connect the content of that chapter to real-world needs in the classroom. </p> <p> <i>Developing and Using Classroom Assessments</i> also incorporates the broader context within which classroom assessments occur. For instance, the major implications of cognitive psychology to assessment are discussed throughout the book, such as the differences between declarative and procedural knowledge, the nature of problem solving, and options for assessing each. Similarly, in recognition that informal assessments represent a high proportion of classroom assessment activities, a full chapter is devoted to using informal observations and questions, and another chapter addresses their use to integrate assessment into instruction. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION</b></p> <p> <i>Developing and Using Classroom Assessments</i> is organized into four parts. Part I provides the teacher with a framework for assessing students. Components of this framework include determining how results of an assessment will be used, establishing the behaviors that indicate whether or not learning has taken place, gathering evidence to determine whether an assessment is valid, and establishing whether it is reasonable to generalize from observed performance to unobserved performance. These components of the assessment framework are illustrated with practical and familiar examples. This assessment framework is then applied extensively in Parts II, III, and IV of the book. </p> <p> Parts II and III are concerned with the development, administration, and scoring of assessments. Part II focuses on written tests, including the essay, short-answer, and objectively scored formats. In Chapters 6 through 9, the reader learns when and how to use each format, including nontrivial attributes that should be built into each type of test item. The reader immediately practices what has been learned by critiquing a combination of well-constructed and faulty test items. Chapter 10 is concerned with helping students take written tests. </p> <p> Part III focuses on alternative assessments, including informal observations and questions, performance assessments, and portfolios. Books on assessment often provide a cursory treatment of the casual observation and questioning of students, even though these informal assessments provide the basis for most formative evaluations in the classroom. Chapter 11 discusses these assessments in some detail. It identifies qualities critical to casual questioning and observation and illustrates their relevance through analogies to social interactions with which readers are very familiar. Two chapters are devoted to performance assessments. Chapter 12 addresses several factors to consider when using this powerful assessment medium, including characteristics, options for scoring, and things to do before creating each performance assessment. Chapter 13 describes in detail procedures to follow when creating performance assessments. The creation of five performance assessments is illustrated. Chapter 14 describes how to use portfolios to integrate assessment and instruction, including how to design portfolios and how to guide their use by students. </p> <p> Part IV focuses on the <i>use</i> of assessments. Chapter 15 is concerned with integrating assessment into instruction. Particular attention is given to specific roles of assessment within cognitivist and constructivist approaches to learning. Chapter 16 describes how to report student performance to parents and others outside the classroom. Issues addressed include inferring what a student knows from what was observed, establishing performance standards, and assigning grades. Chapter 17 addresses the interpretation of students' scores on standardized tests. A significant section helps the reader evaluate common uses of standardized tests that directly affect classroom activities. </p> <p><b>FEATURES OF THE WEB SITE</b></p> <p> A Web site has been developed to supplement this book. Incorporating a Web site provides added flexibility, helps the book achieve relevance, and makes it easier to remain current within a rapidly evolving field. The address of the web site is <b>www.prenhall.com/oosterhof</b>. </p> <p> The Web site is organized into three parts. The first part contains self-instructional modules and illustrations designed to supplement the book. For example, one illustration shows ways to use a word processor to produce written tests more efficiently. Another shows the effect that changing the number of observations has orb the probability of correctly categorizing student achievement. The instructional modules deal with specialized topics that often are included in an introductory measurement course. For instance, one module helps the user understand the significant effect regression often has on test scores. Another shows what correction for guessing or formula scoring does and does not accomplish. A series of modules address standard deviation and correlation along with their role in computing reliability and validity coefficients. </p> <p> The second part of the Web site describes a number of course projects that relate to topics addressed in the book. Many of these projects include worked-out examples created by practicing teachers and others. </p> <p> The third part of the Web site provides links to a variety of sites on the Internet associated with educational measurement, particularly those concerned with assessments in the classroom. These sites provide access to current professional papers and reports, discussion of issues, information about school testing programs, and access to listservs, software, and search engines. </p></p><h2>Textbook of Radiographic Positioning and Related Anatomy</h2><p>This radiography text focuses on about 200 of the most commonly performed radiographic exams, featuring a clear, easy-to-follow organization.

Morrison offers a stimulating look at diverse subjects ranging from cosmology (particularly interstellar communication) to nuclear disarmament to creative ways of teaching science. He also offers his own perspective on his inspiring friendships with Niels Bohr, Richard Feynman, Bernard Peters, and other physics giants.</p><p>There are very few with Philip Morrison&#39;s gifts, few who can lead us with firm knowledge whispering just the right encouragement as he guides us across the great ideas of science. Take this journey with one of the most astute navigators and you&#39;ll find yourself compelled to go deeper into some of the most daring adventures of modern science. Nothing is too grand or seemingly too trivial - the nature of time, the fabric of the atom, what it means to explore scientific horizons, the galaxies, even the search for unknown intelligence in the vast as-yet-uncharted universe. Then as deftly as Morrison takes us on a dazzling tour of the stars, he gently settles down for an intimate stop in the nursery where children have their first encounters with the things of everyday life, everyday things that cause us to wonder and make for discovery. With an equally firm grasp, Morrison, who witnessed the first tests of the atom bomb, takes us unflinchingly through some of the most frightening terrain of modern times, where the arms race can cause our ultimate destruction, but where sanity can still bring us peace. This extraordinary collection of essays by one of the most profound commentators on the successes and failures of the scientific enterprize concludes with lively portraits of men of science - Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, Charles Babbage, among other notable friends and heroes.Philip Morrison is emeritus professor of physics at MIT.</p><h2>Elementary linear algebra with applications</h2><p>Similar to the fourth edition, this new edition features sections on least squares, LU decompositions, comparison of procedures for solving linear systems; a new chapter on numerical methods; and supplementary exercises which have been greatly expanded.</p><p></p><h2>Investment Psychology Explained: Classic Strategies to Beat the Markets</h2><p>Expert advice in a back-to-basics handbook on how to beat the market-the classic way<br> <br> In Investment Psychology Explained Martin J.

By drawing extensively on Kant's logical writings, B�atrice Longuenesse analyzes this controversial claim, and then follows the thread through its continuation in the transcendental deduction of the categories, the transcendental schemata, and the principles of pure understanding. The result is a systematic, persuasive new interpretation of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>.</p><br><p> Longuenesse shows that although Kant adopts his inventory of the forms of judgment from logic textbooks of his time, he is nevertheless original in selecting just those forms he holds to be indispensable to our ability to relate representations to objects. Kant gives formal representation to this relation between conceptual thought and its objects by introducing the term "x" into his analysis of logical forms to stand for the object that is "thought under" the concepts that are combined in judgment. This "x" plays no role in Kant's forms of logical inference, but instead plays a role in clarifying the relation between logical forms (forms of concept subordination) and combinations ("syntheses") of perceptual data, necessary for empirical cognition.</p><br><p> Considering Kant's logical forms of judgment thus helps illuminate crucial aspects of the Transcendental Analytic as a whole, while revealing the systematic unity between Kant's theory of judgment in the first Critique and his analysis of "merely reflective" (aesthetic and teleological) judgments in the third Critique.</p></p><p>"B�atrice Longuenesse's new book is a thorough reconsideration of Kant's first <i>Critique</i>, animated by Kant's greatest philosophical ambitions and informed by the best erudition, superior philosophical intelligence, and close textual fidelity. <i>Kant and the Capacity to Judge</i> will prove to be an important and influential event in Kant studies and in philosophy."--Robert B.

Life insurers led the way, developing numerical practices for measuring individuals and groups, predicting their fates, and intervening in their futures. Emanating from the gilded boardrooms of Lower Manhattan and making their way into drawing rooms and tenement apartments across the nation, these practices soon came to change the futures they purported to divine.<br><br><i>How Our Days Became Numbered</i> tells a story of corporate culture remaking American culture--a story of intellectuals and professionals in and around insurance companies who reimagined Americans' lives through numbers and taught ordinary Americans to do the same. Making individuals statistical did not happen easily. Legislative battles raged over the propriety of discriminating by race or of smoothing away the effects of capitalism's fluctuations on individuals. Meanwhile, debates within companies set doctors against actuaries and agents, resulting in elaborate, secretive systems of surveillance and calculation.<br><br> Dan Bouk reveals how, in a little over half a century, insurers laid the groundwork for the much-quantified, risk-infused world that we live in today. To understand how the financial world shapes modern bodies, how risk assessments can perpetuate inequalities of race or sex, and how the quantification and claims of risk on each of us continue to grow, we must take seriously the history of those who view our lives as a series of probabilities to be managed.</p><p><b>Dan Bouk </b>is assistant professor of history at Colgate University and a member of the Historicizing Big Data working group at the Max Planck Institute for History of Science."<i>How Our Days Became Numbered</i> is a history of insurance, risk, and capitalism. Looking behind the veil at how private life insurance companies defined and priced 'life risks,' Bouk charts the deep philosophical questions, the inequalities and discrimination, the liberatory possibilities that intellectual pioneers struggled over as they built or fought the statistical infrastructure of risk. From the Panic of 1873 to the Great Depression, from life insurance to Social Security, Bouk charts the critical foundations of the world we live in today. Gripping, engaging, deeply human, and written with artistry and grace, Bouk's riveting history raises fundamental questions about corporate and state power in the reduction of individual human beings to a statistic, a risk--'the statistical individual' 'the statistical citizen'--and in the power those values have not just to predict the future, but to make it." (<i>Barbara Welke, University of Minnesota</i>)<br><br>"Life insurers pondered the lives of ordinary people more than any other institution during the period of America's industrialisation. In this history, Bouk sees the emergence of 'numbered' lives, foreshadowing big data. . . . This fascinating history should teach us not to be fatalistic. Big data is what we choose to make it." (<i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>"By the 1930s life insurance was woven so deeply into the nation's economic fabric that, when the Great Depression bit, many families were prepared to maintain their policies at almost any cost. . . . Much of Bouk's excellent work deals with the mathematical and actuarial engineering that insurers undertook between the two depressions to fortify their finances and expand their customer base." (<i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>"Bouk&#x2019;s excellent <i>How Our Days Became Numbered</i> takes us back to the terrain of insurance, where he explores the technologies and calculations that actuaries, executives, and doctors used to transform individuals into 'risks'. He shows most concretely how underlying differences in power and wealth became embedded in financial techniques and assumptions. Time and again, those at the top benefit from instability while the least enfranchised are left with nothing. Inequality looms in all these works, but in Bouk&#x2019;s it constitutes and reconstitutes the architecture of finance itself." (<i>American Quarterly</i>)<br><br>"The history of quantification in life insurance seems like a heavy, serious topic. Bouk shows beautifully how funny it can be, and at the same time how disturbing. A well-ordered life span was needed for business purposes even more than for scientific ones, yet mortality could not easily be stabilized or reduced to an average. The brilliance of this book is in the linking of actuarial calculations of human longevity with themes of racial politics and discrimination that are so fundamental to American history." (<i>Theodore M. Porter, University of California, Los Angeles</i>)<br><br>"<i>How Our Days Became Numbered</i> is an unsurpassed history of risk, statistics, and quantification in modern American life.&nbsp; Focused upon the power of American corporations to remake American culture and illustrating the ways in which ordinary Americans made sense of the numbering of their lives, Bouk has written a beautiful work of cultural and intellectual history." (<i>Jonathan Levy, Princeton University</i>)<br><br>"A key tension in modern liberal societies derives from the tendency of states, firms, and knowledge-makers to use statistical techniques to narrate individual experience. In this beautifully conceived and elegantly written book, Bouk explores this tension by examining how numbers make individuals into risks, following the key protagonists&#x2014;actuaries, medical examiners, and peddlers of fate&#x2014;as they sought to first forecast and then control American lives. An essential work in the burgeoning literatures on risk, numeracy, and the history of capitalism." (<i>Greta Krippner, University of Michigan</i>)<br><br>"Bouk&#x2019;s wonderful new book is a timely history of the roots of our contemporary situation. He explores how the American life insurance industry transitioned from its late-nineteenth century<br> aspirations of predicting fate to an early-twentieth century effort to master death. It is not only a<br> history of actuarial science, but also a cultural history of capitalism &#x2013; and a surprisingly gripping<br> tale for an industry that many, preteens included, are liable to find dull. Bouk narrates the story<br> through a cast of characters who traipse through graveyards, assemble massive databases, and investigate corporate malfeasance. Statistics about life and death, he demonstrates, are anything but boring; rather, they are animated by and occasion moral debates about family, race, and the future of the nation." (<i>Journal of Cultural Economy</i>)<br><br>"It is hard to write engagingly about insurance and the history of statistics. Bouk has succeeded in this feat.<br> Vivid, sometimes poetic prose, surprising examples, and memorable characters enliven the text. This is a very ambitious book." (<i>The American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Bouk, a modern US historian working within a relatively new field called the history of capitalism, offers a fresh perspective. In <i>How Our Days Became Numbered</i>, Bouk provides insight into the development of data-driven mechanisms in consumer finance."

A story of the American will-to-art, it also offers a comprehensive reinterpretation of the development of English as a field of study.<br>D.G. Myers argues that English has been split into three rival and antagonist fields: composition, literary scholarship, and the constructive art of literature, which includes both creative writing and literary criticism. He traces this split from the earliest days of the discipline, when it was called philology, through the rise of English composition and the critical wars of the thirties, down to the present. Along the way, he tells how poets and writers turned to university teaching as a means of economic support, restoring a neglected chapter in the history of American authorship and literary education.</p><p>Prentice Hall Studies in Writing and Culture captures the excitement of an emerging discipline. The writers in this series are challenging basic assumptions, asking new questions, and trying to broaden inquiry about writing and the teaching of writing. These writers raise challenging questions about how we teach and how we build communities of writers. They also investigate subjects as far-ranging as the nature of knowledge and the role that culture plays in shaping pedagogy. The series is particularly concerned with the interplay between language and culture, and about how gender considerations, race, and audience shape our writing and our teaching.

For more information and related resources, please visit http://CollaboratingAgainstTrafficking.info.</p><p>Kirsten Foot is professor of communication at the University of Washington. She has published extensively on organizing processes, digital media, and practice-based theory; she serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Human Trafficking, and on advisory committees for several multi-sector anti-trafficking initiatives.Foot&#x2019;s honest and critical attention throughout her book to the visible and the not-so-visible challenges to cross-sector collaboration against human trafficking is a refreshingly clever approach to partnership-building within this growing field. Though human trafficking is often cited as a crime that is 'hidden in plain sight', Foot works to confront this belief in her book by encouraging stakeholders of all backgrounds and positioning - from victims to survivors to law enforcement, governments and VSPs - to persevere through challenges of collaboration together. In doing so, Foot makes a strong case for an achievable and worthwhile way forward in the anti-trafficking arena in the United States and beyond. (<i>Slavery Today: A Multidisciplinary Journal of Human Trafficking Solutions</i>)<br><br>[Foot's] insights into the roles of gender, race, class, and nonsurvivor or survivor status...contribute important knowledge to the countertrafficking field. They may also point to further lines of inquiry.... Because human trafficking hinges on the disempowerment and debasement of human beings, Foot&#x2019;s special attention to the role of power dynamics within counter-trafficking collaborations appears particularly important for social workers and other collaborators to consider closely.... Foot&#x2019;s many years of study, her balanced and inclusive approach, and her dissemination of practical knowledge makes her a reliable source of information for those who are committed to improving or building their own countertrafficking collaborations. (<i>Social Work</i>)<br><br>Kirsten Foot&#x2019;s book is a timely contribution to the field.... This book in many ways reveals some of the implicit and silent barriers and impediments that influence collaboration efforts; some of which may be true to any sector, and some of which may be specific to the countertrafficking field. Overall, the book offers some interesting and important accounts.... [I]t is a well-written book, it weaves together anecdote, data analysis, and the broader literature in an assured and engaging way, and it will be of interest to those seeking to improve collaboration efforts and to scholars of communication studies more generally. (<i>Journal of Human Trafficking</i>)<br><br>I enjoyed reading this book and believe it should be required reading for all management researchers with an interest in multisector collaboration and its role in social and environmental justice. Foot&#x2019;s work is academically rooted but also the product of direct experience in the field. Her observations are based on the literature, an in-depth study of various collaborations around trafficking, and her own experience volunteering in the sector. The book is full of fascinating vignettes from her field research that bring the topic to life. And given that these vignettes always at least touch on, and often engage deeply with, the horrors of trafficking, they keep the reader highly engaged in a way not often encountered in our field. (<i>Administrative Science Quarterly</i>)<br><br>[Foot] presents a first-hand account and thoughtfully constructed conclusions around the many issues that develop when anti-trafficking organizations work together towards defeating human trafficking.... The book summarizes and provides a clear structure to many issues that have yet to be collectively considered in this field. Foot has written a highly practical text that makes many useful suggestions for improving inter-organizational collaboration by offering group exercises and resources that combat human trafficking. Her protocols are well referenced and include detailed footnotes.... Overall, Foot succeeds in drawing the reader in with captivating notes from her interviews, field work and experiences and utilizes jargon that is accessible to audiences of different levels. This text is succinct yet detailed, and the author makes a clear point to remain as impartial as possible in order to encourage the reader to view issues presented from multiple perspectives. This book is very relevant to inter-professional care because it can be used as a point of reference when considering potential issues and improvements for collaboration within not only criminal justice and social work, but also other health-related and community-focused fields. Foot states that trust, respect and perseverance are the values required to improve interdisciplinary collaboration &#x2013; a necessary and central factor &#x2013; in the fight against human trafficking.

Alexander's <i>Museums in Motion</i> was hailed as a much-needed addition to the museum literature. In combining the history of museums since the eighteenth century with a detailed examination of the function of museums and museum workers in modern society, it served as an essential resource for those seeking to enter to the museum profession and for established professionals looking for an expanded understanding of their own discipline. <br><br>Now, Mary Alexander has produced a newly revised edition of the classic text, bringing it the twenty-first century with coverage of emerging trends, resources, and challenges. New material also includes a discussion of the children's museum as a distinct type of institution and an exploration of the role computers play in both outreach and traditional in-person visits.</p><p><b>Edward Alexander</b> seems to have done it all in terms of history museums. In the 1930s and 40s he led the New York and Wisconsin state historical societies. He brought to Colonial Williamsburg a commitment to intellectual rigor in public interpretation relying on his academic background in U.S. history. He served as president of both AASLH and AAM. After departing Colonial Williamsburg, he established a new museum studies program at the University of Delaware, where he taught until his retirement.<br><br><b>Mary Alexander</b> has been an active museum educator in Washington, DC since 1970. She has worked for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Museum Education Roundtable, George Washington Bicentennial Center (Alexandria, VA), National Archives, Mount Vernon, AASLH's Common Agenda for History Museums, Hillwood Museum and Montgomery County Historical Society. Today, she administers grants for the Maryland Historical Trust, helping historical and cultural museums across Maryland address their professional needs.What a joy it is to have a new edition of <i>Museums in Motion</i>. Mary Alexander has done her father, Edward Alexander, and the museum profession proud with her skillful reworking and polishing of one of the central texts in American museology. This work is ripe with insight that will educate the novice and challenge and inspire the most seasoned cultural worker. Ultimately <i>Museums in Motion</i> is both a wonderfully written history of museum practices and a clarion call that reminds us of the changing environment that museums face today. (Bunch, Lonnie)<br><br>Mary Alexander's updated version of her father's 1979 text is a long-awaited and much-welcome addition to the literature of museum mtudies. (Aldona Sendzikas)<br><br>Mary Alexander has done an excellent job of updating her father's work while keeping the flavor of having a conversation with him....<i>Museums in Motion</i> will continue to be one of the few books that should be on every museum professional's bookshelf regardless of the museum's discipline or the staff member's job description. (<i>History News</i>)<br><br>The revised edition of <i>Museums in Motion</i> will extend the useful life of an invaluable text for decades. Shining through the original text was respect for museums of the past, as well as insights about how they have shaped us, as museum workers, and our institutions. This quality continues in the new edition, with important updates, especially about the public dimension of museums and the impact of electronic tools on museums' missions, operations, and interpretation.

From the Greeks to Godel, the mathematics is brilliant; the cast of characters is distinguished; the ebb and flow of ideas is everywhere evident. And, while tracing the development of European mathematics, the authors do not overlook the contributions of Chinese, Indian, and Arabic civilizations. Without doubt, this is--and will long remain--a classic one-volume history of mathematics and mathematicians who create it.&#34; --William Dunham Author, Journey Through Genius, The Great Theorems of Mathematics &#34;When we read a book like A History of Mathematics, we get the picture of a mounting structure, ever taller and broader and more beautiful and magnificent--and with a foundation, moreover, that is as untainted and as functional now as it was when Thales worked out the first geometrical theorems nearly 26 centuries ago.&#34; --From the Foreword by Isaac Asimov &#34;One of the most useful and comprehensive general introductions to the subject.&#34; --J. W. Dauben The City University of New York &#34;Both readable and scholarly, this book can serve as a fine introduction to the topic and also a reference book.&#34; --J. David Bolter University of North Carolina Author of Turing&#39;s Man Revised to make it more accessible to a general audience, A History of Mathematics paints a vivid picture of humankind&#39;s relationship with numbers. Updated and expanded, it now offers broadened coverage of twentieth century advances in probability and computers, and updated references to further reading. A feature that will be of interest to every reader is an appendix containing an extensive chronological table of mathematical and general historical developments.</p><p>What do you mean there's no chapter 0? Whether or not you think that's a deficit, <i>A History of Mathematics</i> more than makes up for it with its depth and engaging analysis of the development of the "flawless science." Historian Carl B. Boyer designed it as a practical textbook for communicating math's complex timelines to interested college students in 1968; Uta C. Merzbach has gently revised it to bring it in line with current thought. Much of the early chapters are untouched, with new 19th- and 20th-century chapters covering Boyer's omissions and new and revised references guiding the reader to additional resources.<p> From the origins of numbering to the future of computing, the authors strive for comprehensive examination and clear, simple explanations. Some of the math will daunt those who have never taken college-level courses (or have forgotten what they learned), but some of the more elaborate technical material can be skipped if needed. Especially helpful is the extensive timeline-appendix that proceeds from the beginning of time to the late 20th century. Whether you're using it to gain a better understanding of mathematics or to broaden your awareness of the historical record, <i>A History of Mathematics</i> will help you make sense of the wide world of numbers. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p></p><h2>The Boy in the Bush</h2><p><p>Unique among D.

Roszak believes that the cybernetic model of the human mind as a thinking machine is fundamentally wrong; ideas have living meanings and produce convictions, something machines will never have. He debunks the information economy touted by futurologists like Toffler and Naisbitt, arguing that the home computer as an "information center" is a chimera. The influx of military-industrial funds into artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology research, he charges, has brought to the fore the severe limitations of these disciplines in solving real-world problems. Roszak raps the computer industry for commercial opportunism, especially in the schools, where the computer is an expensive mechanical teacher's aid; he cites evidence that most educational software has little real value. Computer manufacturers envision "fully networked campuses" where college students and teachers all have micros and rarely need to meet. Roszak cries foul, noting that it's time to rethink a technology that should not be merely grafted onto our culture. His humanistic counterattack on the cult of computers is devastating. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fieldbook of Pacific North West Sea Creatures</h2><p>This book shows over two hundred common marine animals as they appear undisturbed in their natural habits.

Henrick, author of Crimson Tide and Nightwatch</p><p>By 1944, forty Americans?missionaries, escaped POWs, and sugar planters?had endured nearly three years of hell while hiding from the Japanese in the mountains of the central Philippines. They had moved frequently from one primitive hideout to the next, always in danger, subsisting on what little the locals could spare. They had seen friends and family captured, even murdered. And their faith in God, their country, and themselves had been stretched to the breaking point.<p>Then word came that MacArthur was sending a submarine, the Crevalle, to save them. The refugees confronted what they hoped would be their final trial: a hundred-mile trek south to meet the sub, a trek that would take them through dense jungle and trackless swamps with the Japanese an ever-present threat and the knowledge that one false step could result in tragedy.</p><p>But the refugees had no idea their dramatic rescue was just a cover for a mission of great strategic importance.</p><p>As MacArthur and Nimitz pushed the Japanese back, island by island, they put to flight Admiral Koga Mineichi, Yamamoto?s successor and the commander of Japan?s powerful Combined Fleet. Koga carried with him the detailed plans for the imperial navy?s long-planned "decisive battle" at sea. But his plane crashed and the plans washed up on a Philippine beach. Thanks to the courage of two fishermen, the secret papers soon found their way to an extraordinary American guerrilla leader, who then risked everything to get them to the rendezvous with the Crevalle.</p><p>But would the Crevalle reach the plans and the refugees before the Japanese caught wind of the scheme? The Crevalle and her heroic crew would first have to sail through enemy-infested waters to reach the island.

These four lectures constituted an overview of his then-controversial theory of relativity. Princeton University Press made the lectures available under the title <i>The Meaning of Relativity</i>, the first book by Einstein to be produced by an American publisher. As subsequent editions were brought out by the Press, Einstein included new material amplifying the theory. A revised version of the appendix "Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field," added to the posthumous edition of 1956, was Einstein's last scientific paper.</p></p><p>In 1921, a young Albert Einstein traveled to America to give four lectures at Princeton University, paving the way for a more complete acceptance of his theory of general relativity. These lectures are published together as <i>The Meaning of Relativity</i>, and were revised with each new edition until Einstein's death. Despite Einstein's profession that he thought without using words, his examples and descriptions of the relativistic world he perceived are clear and easy to follow. Unfortunately for nontechnical readers, his presentation requires deep diversions into mathematics often enough to break up the flow of his narrative, and they may find this rough terrain. But for the mathematically sophisticated or the devoted scientific historian, these lectures are profoundly illuminating--Einstein's bright, quiet genius shines through in the simplicity and economy of his writing. Two appendices follow the lectures: the first covers advances and experimental verifications after 1921; the second, "Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field," was Einstein's last scientific paper. <i>The Meaning of Relativity</i> documents a revolution in progress and yields to the careful student deeper truths than those found in physics textbooks. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Brian Greene</b> is professor of physics and of mathematics at Columbia University.

"Whenever the American dream suffers a catastrophic setback, Barber's Adagio plays on the radio."--Alex Ross, author of The Rest is Noise<br><br>In the first book ever to explore Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, music and literary critic Thomas Larson tells the story of the prodigal composer and his seminal masterpiece: from its composition in 1936, when Barber was just twenty-six, to its orchestral premiere two years later, led by the great Arturo Toscanini, and its fascinating history as America's secular hymn for grieving our dead. Older Americans know Adagio from the funerals and memorials for Presidents Roosevelt and Kennedy, Albert Einstein, and Grace Kelly. Younger Americans recall the work as the antiwar theme of the movie <i>Platoon</i>. Still others treasure the piece in its choral version under the name Agnus Dei. More recently, mourners heard Adagio played as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Barber's Adagio is truly the saddest music ever written, enrapturing listeners with its lyric beauty as few laments have.<br><br>The Adagio's sonorous intensity also speaks of the turbulent inner life of its composer, Samuel Barber (1910-1981), a melancholic who, in later years, descended into alcoholism and severe depression. Part biography, part cultural history, part memoir, <i>The Saddest Music Ever Written</i> captures the deep emotion Barber's great elegy has stirred throughout the world during its seventy-five-year history, becoming an icon of our national soul.</p><p>Journalist, critic, and memoirist, Thomas Larson is the author of three books: The Sanctuary of Illness: A Memoir of Heart Disease, The Saddest Music Ever Written: The Story of Samuel Barber&#39;s &#34;Adagio for Strings,&#34; and The Memoir and the Memoirist: Reading and Writing Personal Narrative. As a staff writer for the San Diego Reader, he has written more than 50 feature-length cover stories. He teaches in the MFA Program at Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio, and is the Book Review editor for River Teeth. He holds workshops and lectures on memoir writing, American music, and heart disease throughout the United States. His website is thomaslarson.com.&#x201c;This is a wonderful examination of the effects of an artistic artifact on culture and, conversely, the various uses (undreamt of by the composer) to which the music has been put by others.

He lives in New York City.Grade 6 Up?A compelling, cogent collection of well-researched primary-source materials reflecting Douglass's insight, integrity, and intelligence. Sixty-six speeches, encompassing a span of 40 years, are chronologically divided into sections devoted to before, during, and after the Civil War. A brief descriptive annotation introduces each, speech noting its date, place delivered, and circumstances surrounding its presentation. The selections, mainly two to three pages in length, afford a rich resource for report writers, orators, and debaters. Their impassioned language clamors for justice, decries inequality, and challenges readers to envision the past and to assess its validity and timeliness against today's headlines. The emotional impact of the text is given form and substance as single-and double-page linocuts visually transform prose into pictures of stark majesty sharply defined by unquestioned skill. These illustrations mirror the words reflecting the cruel nature of slavery and the vision of one man who sought to abolish injustice. Brief profiles of the subject's contemporaries?Susan B. Anthony, William Lloyd Garrison, Anthony Burns, and Harriet Tubman?are appended. Douglass's words live again in this volume, invoking young people to never give up the struggle for freedom and equality for all.?Joanne Kelleher, Commack Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stalin Vs.

Nietzsche and Political Thought reclaims the political implications of Nietzsche&#39;s work: it shows how his philosophy of power addresses key issues in modern political thought especially those having to do with the historical and cultural nature of human agency.In this thought-provoking study, Mark Warren claims entirely new ground. He develops a &#34;postmetaphysical&#34; political philosophy that provides a link between Nietzsche&#39;s work and the later philosophies of the Frankfurt School and Michel Foucault. Warren comes to terms with Nietszche&#39;s views on power, freedom, domination, equality, ideology - topics that recent interpretations have neglected in favor of a focus on the literary and philosophical aspects of his work, but that in fact make these literary and philosophical concerns relevant to social and political thought. Importantly, Warren draws a distinction between the implications of Nietzsche&#39;s theories concerning power and agency for contemporary political thought and Nietzsche&#39;s own politics. He demonstrates how Nietzsche&#39;s actual political views did not reflect - and in large part falsified - his own philosophical insights which taken by themselves point toward a pluralistic society in which egalitarianism underscores individuality. But his politics, Warren argues, derived too heavily from a deficient understanding of modern social and political organization.Nietzsche and Political Thought is included in the series Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought, edited by Thomas McCarthy.</p><p>Mark Warren is Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science at Northwestern University.This is a first-rate piece of work. It articulates a clear position, is award of the issues that have to be taken into account, and defends itself against most possible objections. No book I know of makes it as clear why so many diverse opinions of Nietzsche's politics can exist.&#x2015;Tracy B. Strong, University of California (<i>Endorsement</i>)<br><br>This book is always intelligent and is written with clarity. The breadth of the author's concerns keeps the text in touch with the catholic interests of Nietzsche himself.&#x2015;William E. Connolly, The John Hopkins University (<i>Endorsement</i>)</p><h2>Word into Silence</h2><p>This book is written to encourage people to &#34;turn aside, &#34; not to avoid or escape life, but to discover through meditation their deepest center and encounter the spirit of Jesus dwelling within. To understand Christian truths on a theoretical level is one thing; for these truths to come alive in our hearts is something very different. But in the silent saying of our short prayer, our mantra, in the simplicity of concentrating upon God in silence and openness, this &#34;realization&#34; can become a reality; enabling our relationships with others to grow in depth and understanding.</p><p>JOHN MAIN became a Benedictine monk after diplomatic service in the Far East and teaching law at Trinity College, Dublin. He founded an open Benedictine community in Montreal from which sprang the World Community for Christian Meditation, a worldwide spiritual family linked through the daily practice of meditation, operating in 114 countries and with 100,000 members worldwide.</p><h2>The Story of Lynx</h2><p><p>"In olden days, in a village peopled by animal creatures, lived Wild Cat (another name for Lynx). He was old and mangy, and he was constantly scratching himself with his cane. From time to time, a young girl who lived in the same cabin would grab the cane, also to scratch herself. In vain Wild Cat kept trying to talk her out of it. One day the young lady found herself pregnant; she gave birth to a boy. Coyote, another inhabitant of the village, became indignant. He talked all of the population into going to live elsewhere and abandoning the old Wild Cat, his wife, and their child to their fate . . . "<br> <br> So begins the Nez Perc� myth that lies at the heart of <i>The Story of Lynx</i>, Claude L�vi-Strauss's most accessible examination of the rich mythology of American Indians. In this wide-ranging work, the master of structural anthropology considers the many variations in a story that occurs in both North and South America, but especially among the Salish-speaking peoples of the Northwest Coast. He also shows how centuries of contact with Europeans have altered the tales.<br> <br> L�vi-Strauss focuses on the opposition between Wild Cat and Coyote to explore the meaning and uses of <i>gemellarity</i>, or twinness, in Native American culture. The concept of dual organization that these tales exemplify is one of non-equivalence: everything has an opposite or other, with which it coexists in unstable tension. In contrast, L�vi-Strauss argues, European notions of twinness&#x2014;as in the myth of Castor and Pollux&#x2014;stress the essential sameness of the twins. This fundamental cultural difference lay behind the fatal clash of European and Native American peoples.<br> <br> <i>The Story of Lynx</i> addresses and clarifies all the major issues that have occupied L�vi-Strauss for decades, and is the only one of his books in which he explicitly connects history and structuralism. The result is a work that will appeal to those interested in American Indian mythology.</p></p><p>In this widely praised and accessible work, Claude Levi-Strauss examines the rich mythology of American Indians and illustrates how centuries of contact with Europeans have altered the tales. Levi-Strauss focuses on the opposition between Wild Cat and Coyote, two figures in a Nez Perce myth, to explore the meaning and uses of gemellarity, or twinness, in Native American mythology.Claude Levi-Strauss is professor emeritus at the College de France.</p><h2>Feed Yourself, Feed Your Family: Good Nutrition and Healthy Cooking for New Moms and Growing Families</h2><p>A BLUEPRINT FOR A LIFETIME OF HEALTHY MEALS<br><br><b>From pregnancy to breastfeeding through weaning and beyond, the comprehensive one-stop nutrition and cooking guide for mothers eager to nourish the whole growing family with healthy and delicious meals</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Your approach to eating changes when you become pregnant, give birth, and become responsible for feeding an infant, toddler, or growing child.

It seems everyone from your doctor to your sister to your sister's best friend has an opinion on what you should have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br><br>"Don't drink coffee."<br><br>"Our patients do fine with a small amount of coffee-but be careful with fish."<br><br>"Stay away from soft cheese. And watch out for the fat content in hard cheese."<br><br>"Cheese is packed with calcium you need-why aren't you eating any cheese?"<br><br>"Take your prenatal vitamin and you'll be fine."<br><br>Eventually you separate the wheat from the chaff (speaking of which, don't forget to eat a lot of whole grains) and grow more confident about your food choices as you strive for a healthy pregnancy. The best advice tends to lie somewhere between extreme restriction and complete indulgence. Most experts and research agree, for instance, that a cup of coffee a day is usually okay but limit your caffeine intake to no more than 200 milligrams per day;1 soft, unpasteurized cheese is among the foods that may contain dangerous listeriosis- causing bacteria and so should be avoided during pregnancy; certain fish, such as swordfish, can carry high levels of mercury and should be off your pregnancy menu; be aware of the high saturated fat and calorie content of hard cheeses such as cheddar; and yes, prenatal vitamins are really important. (We'll return to these and other dos and don'ts later in this chapter.)<br><br>If you are reading this book, we're assuming you're already probably taking good care of yourself and your growing baby, and that you're regularly checking in with your physician for advice and information. We're also assuming that since you're planning to breastfeed, you undoubtedly have questions about how what you're eating now will impact how you nourish your baby after she's born.<br><br>As we pointed out in the introduction, there is no magical breastfeeding diet that can be consumed during pregnancy (or afterward) that will guarantee a robust and steady supply of breast milk. However, as you undoubtedly have discovered, maintaining a healthy diet during pregnancy has numerous, excellent benefits for mother and child, whether or not breastfeeding is a goal. And you are more likely to be successful with breastfeeding if you stay healthy and feel strong.<br><br>Once you are holding your new nursling in your arms, you'll naturally be less inclined to spend your time planning and preparing meals for yourself and any other members of your household, though your own nutritional needs will still be extremely important! (If you're fast- forwarding to what mealtime will look like after the baby comes, remember that we're here to help. A major goal of this book is to help you balance your dietary needs with those of your nursling, as well as those of other family members.) Therefore, these months and weeks before you give birth and begin breastfeeding are an ideal time to focus more precisely on your diet.<br><br>Your Body Is Changing-What About Your Diet?<br><br>In the first trimester of a normal pregnancy, a healthy mother-to-be's nutritional and caloric needs won't differ dramatically from what she ate before pregnancy.<br><br>If you're eating properly, you'll be able to nourish your growing baby adequately on your prepregnancy diet (with the exception of items to eliminate for safety reasons; see pages 31-32 later in this chapter), though your tastes for certain foods may be altered due to morning sickness or other hormonal changes. It's when you reach the second trimester, however, that the picture begins to change and the increased need for certain macro- and micronutrients, as well as calories, becomes apparent. This phase generally coincides with when you can't button your old jeans!<br><br>How much more do you need in terms of nutrients and calories? How much weight should you gain?<br><br>Generally, physicians and experts in maternal nutrition recommend that in the second trimester you should up your calories by about 300-350 per day; in your third trimester, you may be advised to increase this by another 100 calories.<br><br>As for weight gain, the recommended amount depends on your prepregnancy BMI (body mass index). It simply doesn't make sense to tell a 5'2" woman who is slightly overweight to gain the same amount of weight as a 5'7" woman who is exceedingly thin. Before the widespread use of BMIs, however, pregnant women were frequently given overly general guidelines. Check with your physician to get the number that is right for you, and start with an accurate prepregnancy BMI. (If you are overweight or obese, it's especially important to consult with your physician regarding weight gain.)<br><br>While weight gain will vary from woman to woman, less than half of the amount will come from true "baby weight"-that is, the combined weight of the fetus itself, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid. The balance of the weight gain is maternal reproductive tissues such as increased uterus size, blood (its volume increases by 50 percent), breast growth, and additional protein and fat stores. Your heart size alone increases by 12 percent. (We like to think that mothers have the biggest hearts in the world!)<br><br>Depending on where you are in your pregnancy, you have undoubtedly noticed that your breasts are changing, beginning with tenderness and soreness that are completely normal. They are also growing rapidly as your body works to make more milk ducts to prepare for breastfeeding. Whether you start out small-breasted or full-figured, the size of your breasts during pregnancy does not impact your ability to nurse your child.<br><br>Does your intention to breastfeed mean that you need to supplement or alter those numbers for recommended weight gain and extra calories-in any way? Not at all. Beyond following a healthy and balanced diet during pregnancy, which we will look at in the next section, you don't need to take any special nutritional measures to prepare your body for breastfeeding.<br><br>What to Eat Now<br><br>You've got your to-do list in hand to get your baby's room or sleeping space ready ahead of time-perhaps it means you'll assemble some furniture, launder some tiny clothing, stockpile diapers, or hang the cow-jumping-over-the-moon picture on the wall. The room, either the nursery or the bedroom where Mom sleeps, will be ready, but what about that other part of your house-the one with the food? Baby's new home can wait a little longer, but let's take a look at what's in your kitchen right now. Whether you're battling morning sickness or you're constantly ravenous (or both), whether you're a reluctant meal planner or absolutely love to cook, now is the time to get your food organized.<br><br>Naturally, it makes sense to plan around your changing nutritional requirements. In the first trimester, as we pointed out, if you're eating a healthy diet your body doesn't need much more in the way of calories and nutrition. But starting in the second trimester, and as mentioned earlier, your physician will probably recommend about 350 more calories per day until you give birth. (Remember, this calorie recommendation depends on your BMI-check with your doctor to find out how many calories you need to add.) Generally, that translates to a well-planned snack or two, or perhaps a larger portion of a nutritious food during mealtime-but not an entire extra meal or double portions of an entr�e or dessert. If you overeat, the extra weight gain will not vanish without significant effort. (Yes, you will use extra calories when you are breastfeeding, but postpregnancy weight loss is still harder than pregnancy weight gain. For more on this topic, see page 203.)<br><br>A Blueprint for a Lifetime of Healthy Meals<br><br>Here's a simple formula for putting together a healthy meal-not just right now but after your baby arrives, and even after your children are old enough to take you out for Mother's Day brunch and when they have kids of their own. This is also a basic but balanced blueprint for assembling just about any family meal. Growing children will require a serving of dairy at each meal, too; if you are pregnant or nursing include three servings of dairy (skim milk is a good choice) for yourself as well. If you or your family does not consume dairy, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about alternative calcium sources. The chart in the next section includes some nondairy calcium sources, but there are more.<br><br>Strive to include each of the following "big three" in every meal you consume.*<br><br>1. Lean protein (eggs, dairy, meat, fish, legumes)-1 serving.<br><br>2. Vegetables and fruits (add whole fruit for breakfast)-2 or more servings. (Nutrition experts recommend filling half your plate with veggies and fruit.)<br><br>3. Complex carbohydrates (from whole-grain bread products or starchy vegetables such as potatoes, corn, and peas)-1 serving. (For more on complex carbohydrates, see the box on pages 14-15. n<br><br>* For average serving sizes of items such as meat and other protein sources, fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and whole grains, see the sample food listings in the chart on pages 10-11 later in this chapter. When serving sizes are given in weight, it's more helpful to picture an everyday object for a visual cue. Some common examples: 3 ounces of fish, chicken, or beef is about the size of a deck of cards; 1 ounce of hard cheese is about four dice; one serving of fruit is the size of a baseball; 1/2 cup of veggies is a rounded handful.<br><br>Getting the Dietary Components You Need: What, Why, and How Much<br><br>Here are some of the major nutrients you should focus on right now, along with some suggested food sources and calorie counts per average serving. Make sure these items are finding their way into your grocery cart and your kitchen. (See our pantry and freezer/refrigerator lists later in this chapter.) Many of these foods can and should also play an important role in your diet after your baby is born. We'll refer you back to this chart in subsequent chapters, with postpartum information on these nutrients.<br><br>In some cases, you'll see a comment such as "easiest to get in supplement form." If you are wondering about the food sources versus supplements with regard to calcium and iron, turn to pages 15-17.<br><br>A note on adding calories: We don't recommend you get all your extra daily calories from one food source, as it's preferable to vary your diet so your body gets a balance of different nutrients. (And to get 350 calories' worth of vitamin-rich leafy greens, for instance, you'd have to consume about 30 cups of cooked spinach!) Look at the calories per serving of each food on the next pages to mix and match and put together your own balanced 350-calorie boost.*<br><br>WHAT AND HOW MUCH<br><br>In general, about 70 grams per day; amount depends on the mom's weight and number of babies she is carrying<br><br>WHY IT'S GOOD FOR YOU NOW<br><br>Gives you building blocks for new tissue synthesis, curbs your hunger, and contains amino acids necessary for fetal growth.<br><br>WHERE TO FIND IT IN YOUR KITCHEN<br><br>Eggs, poultry, meat, milk, beans, nuts<br><br>CALORIES/KEY NUTRIENTS PER SERVING OF SOME SAMPLE FOODS<br><br>1 egg: 80 cal, 6 g protein<br><br>3 oz chicken (breast): 163 cal, 26 g protein<br><br>3 oz beef: 292 cal, 21 g protein<br><br>1 cup skim milk: 86 cal, 8 g protein<br><br>1 cup soy milk: 79 cal, 6.6 g protein<br><br>1/2 cup cooked chickpeas: 143 cal, 8 g protein<br><br>1/2 cup cooked soybeans: 149 cal, 14 g protein<br><br>1 oz almonds: 174 cal, 6 g protein<br><br>1 oz peanuts: 164 cal, 7 g protein<br><br>1 oz walnuts: 190 cal, 4 g protein<br><br>2 tbsp peanut butter: 188 cal, 8 g protein<br><br>1,000 milligrams per day<br><br>Bone health (yours and your baby's).

How can language be used to trace different peoples and their past? Are certain languages similar because of common descent or language contact? Assuming no prior knowledge of linguistics, this textbook introduces readers to the rich diversity of human languages, familiarizing students with the variety and typology of languages around the world. Linguistic terms and concepts are explained, in the text and in the glossary, and illustrated with simple, accessible examples. Eighteen language maps and numerous language family charts enable students to place a language geographically or genealogically. A supporting website includes additional language maps and sound recordings that can be used to illustrate the peculiarities of the sound systems of various languages. &#39;Test yourself&#39; questions throughout the book make it easier for students to analyze data from unfamiliar languages.</p><p>What do all human languages have in common and in what ways are they different?

In this provocative work, psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar exposes the psychological roots of Hindu-Muslim violence and examines with grace and intensity the subjective experience of religious hatred in his native land.<br><br>With honesty, insight, and unsparing self-reflection, Kakar confronts the profoundly enigmatic relations that link individual egos to cultural moralities and religious violence. His innovative psychological approach offers a framework for understanding the kind of ethnic-religious conflict that has so vexed social scientists in India and throughout the world.<br><br>Through riveting case studies, Kakar explores cultural stereotypes, religious antagonisms, ethnocentric histories, and episodic violence to trace the development of both Hindu and Muslim psyches. He argues that in early childhood the social identity of every Indian is grounded in traditional religious identifications and communalism. Together these bring about deep-set psychological anxieties and animosities toward the other. For Hindus and Muslims alike, violence becomes morally acceptable when communally and religiously sanctioned. As the changing pressures of modernization and secularism in a multicultural society grate at this entrenched communalism, and as each group vies for power, ethnic-religious conflicts ignite. <i>The Colors of Violence</i> speaks with eloquence and urgency to anyone concerned with the postmodern clash of religious and cultural identities.<br></p><p>For decades India has been intermittently tormented by brutal outbursts of religious violence, thrusting thousands of ordinary Hindus and Muslims into bloody conflict.

What followed was the most talked-about obscenity trial of the twentieth century, which resulted in a &#39;not guilty&#39; verdict. Penguin&#39;s successful defence of the book&#39;s literary merit was a victory of free speech, and made Lawrence&#39;s story of the affair between a married woman and her gamekeeper an instant bestseller. This special edition celebrates the 50th anniversary of the first UK publication of D.H. Lawrence&#39;s unexpurgated novel in 1960 and the most talked-about obscenity trial of the twentieth century. It includes afterwords by Geoffrey Robertson QC, about the legal case that changed Britain, and Steve Hare, revealing the story behind Penguin&#39;s decision to publish, as well as a detailed timeline and never-before-published letters and documents relating to the trial.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous of Lawrence's novels, the 1928 <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i> is no longer distinguished for the once-shockingly explicit treatment of its subject matter--the adulterous affair between a sexually unfulfilled upper-class married woman and the game keeper who works for the estate owned by her wheelchaired husband. Now that we're used to reading about sex, and seeing it in the movies, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Lawrence was a masterful and lyrical writer, whose story takes us bodily into the world of its characters.The Cambridge edition of Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover is the first ever to restore to Lawrence&#39;s most famous novel the words that he wrote. Removing corruptions and errors and including hundreds of new words, phrases and sentences - this is the only text that can be read or quoted with confidence.</p><h2>The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-Gardism</h2><p>This is a fascinating exploration of the deeply ambiguous relationship between modern art and popular culture, focusing on the work of Picasso and Duchamp in France in the first two decades of this century. Analyzing art, criticism, and popular culture of the period, Jeffrey Weiss shows that the elements of parody and irony that occurred throughout the avant-garde movement greatly influenced public perception - and miscomprehension - of new art.<br>Linking Picasso's innovations in cubist collage to the puns and topical jokes of the music-hall and theatrical revue, Weiss also links Duchamp's readymades and Large Glass to hoaxes in the daily papers. He shows that cubist and futurist styles were put to parodic use in caricature, advertising, stage design and other forms of popular visual culture, and were often interpreted in the press as examples of flagrant self-publicity. The cultural assimilation of avant-garde art, not often considered in histories of modernism, ultimately mirrors the role of the comic in Picasso and Duchamp.</p><p>Jeffrey Weiss is research associate at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.</p><h2>Stradivari (Musical Performance and Reception)</h2><p>For over 200 years, Antonio Stradivari has been universally regarded as the greatest violin maker who ever lived, yet it is not widely known that he made virtually every kind of bowed- and plucked-string instrument popular in the Baroque period, including lutes, viols, mandolins, guitars, and harps. Stradivari provides a fascinating biography of this legendary maker, based on newly discovered material in church and civic archives, alongside technical descriptions and analyses of many of the maker&#39;s workshop materials preserved in the Museo Stradivariano in Cremona, particularly as they relate to extant and lost instruments, baroque stringing and instrument adjustment, and early performance practice. There are separate chapters for each type of instrument, allowing the reader to easily locate information. The book contains tables of measurements of Stradivari&#39;s forms and patterns, over 100 black and white photographs and drawings, and colour photographs of 16 of Stradivari&#39;s most important violins, violas, and cellos.</p><p>Since the eighteenth century Antonio Stradivari has been universally regarded as the greatest of all violin makers.

Lee and Chinese Art Collecting in Postwar America</h2><p><i>Separating Sheep from Goats</i> investigates the history of collecting and exhibiting Chinese art through the lens of the career of renowned American curator and museum director Sherman E. Lee (1918&#x2013;2008). Drawing upon artworks and archival materials, Noelle Giuffrida excavates an international society of collectors, dealers, curators, and scholars who constituted the art world in which Lee operated. From his early training in Michigan and his work in Occupied Japan as a monuments man to his acquisitions, exhibitions, and publications for museums in Detroit, Seattle, and Cleveland, this study traces how Lee shaped public and scholarly understandings of Chinese art. By examining transnational efforts to collect and present Chinese art and scrutinizing scholarly and museological discourses of the postwar era, this book contributes to the historiography of both Chinese art and American museums.</p><p>"Noelle Giuffrida's book brings to light a largely missing chapter in the history of Chinese painting&nbsp;studies in America. While curators&nbsp;produce exhibition catalogues that sum up their scholarship, it is their work preparing for and studying works of art in realms outside the academic world (e.g.,&nbsp;dealers&#x2019; galleries, the homes of private collectors, and museum storerooms)&nbsp;that is often&nbsp;hidden to academic scholars and the public alike. Opening up the intricate structures and illustrating the importance of&nbsp;these realms&nbsp;is one of the many&nbsp;contributions of this&nbsp;book."&#x2014;Stephen Little, Florence and Harry Sloan Curator of Chinese Art and Head, Chinese, Korean, and South and Southeast Asian Departments, Los Angeles County Museum of Art<br><br> "The original content in Noelle Giuffrida's book centers on both the words and the images that facilitated such basic debates as sinology vs. art history by reconstructing the inner history of collecting in postwar America. With primary sources from both museum and family archives and a great number of illustrations, Giuffrida's book is unique in addressing those scholarly debates about 'objects' from a&nbsp;museum studies&nbsp;perspective, an increasingly important branch of art history."&#x2014;Zaixin Hong, Professor of Art History, University of Puget Sound<b>Noelle Giuffrida</b> is a professor and curator of East Asian art whose research and scholarship focuses on the history of collecting, exhibitions, and scholarship on Chinese art in twentieth-century America and the visual culture of Daoism in late imperial China.</p><h2>Feasts of the Bible</h2><p>Throughout the Old Testament, God commanded the Children of Israel to observe these holy days (holidays) as memorials to the mighty things that he had done in their lives.&nbsp;This bestselling pamphlet celebrates and explains the <i>Feasts &amp; Holidays of the Bible. </i>The glossy full-color pamphlet&#x2019;s easy-to-use fold-out chart provides the name of each holiday, date of observance, explanation of the holiday, and reveals how each holiday points to Jesus as the promised Messiah.&nbsp;Holidays include: Passover, Firstfruits, Yom Kippur, and Purim among others. Know more about the Hebrew roots of Christianity. <i>Size: 8.5"x 5.5" unfolds to 33" long. Fits inside most Bible covers.</i> &nbsp; As a Jew, these feasts and holidays were celebrated each year by Jesus. The pamphlet offers an excellent way to teach Christians about their Jewish roots and to discover Yeshua, &#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; in each &#x201c;holy day.&#x201d; The pamphlet lists the occasion&#x2019;s Hebrew lettering, pronunciation, symbolism of Jesus, Bible references and New Testament fulfillment for the feasts and holidays below: <ul> <li>Passover&nbsp;(Pesach)</li> <li>Unleavened Bread (Hag HaMatzot)</li> <li>Firstfruits (Yom HaBikkurim)</li> <li>Feast of Weeks or Pentecost&nbsp;(Shavuot)</li> <li>Feast of Trumpets or Rosh HaShanah (New Year)</li> <li>Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur</li> <li>Tabernacles or Sukkot (Feast of Booths)</li> <li>Rejoicing in the Law or Torah (Simchat)</li> <li>Feast of Dedication or Hanukkah (Chanukah or Feast of Lights)</li> <li>Feast of Lots or Purim</li> </ul> The <i>Feasts &amp; Holidays of the Bible </i>offers important insights into the works of God on behalf of his chosen people.&nbsp;The <i>Feasts &amp; Holidays of the Bible</i> pamphletis a celebration of a rich and meaningful heritage given to believers through Christ. The pamphlet reveals insightful and historical facts about each of the holidays, for example&#x2014;<br> <ul> <li>Passover: A hymn is usually sung at the end of the Passover service, as was the case with Jesus and his disciples during the Last Supper (Matthew 26:30)</li> <li>During the Rosh HaShanah synagogue services, the shofar (ram&#x2019;s horn) is blown 100 times</li> <li>Hanukkah is also known as the Feast of Lights or the Feast of Dedication because of a legendary miraculous provision of oil for the eternal light in the Temple</li> <li>Purim marks the deliverance of the Jews through Jewish Queen Esther</li> </ul> The pamphlet offers fascinating facts about the feasts of the Bible, for instance: <ul> <li>Leviticus 23 is sometimes called &#x201c;God&#x2019;s calendar of redeeming grace&#x201d; because of&nbsp;44 verses that tell of God&#x2019;s redemptive plan</li> <li>God told Moses that seven of the feasts were to be &#x201c;appointed feasts of the Lord&#x201d; and were to be proclaimed as sacred assemblies (Leviticus 23: 1, 2)</li> <li>Three of the feasts were pilgrimage feasts</li> </ul> Also included in the <i>Feasts &amp; Holidays of the Bible</i> pamphlet is a calendar chart that shows the date of each upcoming event through 20014. For example, for the following years, Yom Kippur, the &#x201c;Day of Atonement,&#x201d; is observed on the following days (beginning sundown the previous day): <ul> <li>2008&#x2014;October 9</li> <li>2009&#x2014;September 28</li> <li>2010&#x2014;September 18</li> <li>2011&#x2014;October 8</li> <li>2012&#x2014;September 26</li> <li>2014&#x2014;September 14</li> <li>2014&#x2014;October 4</li> </ul> This is a fantastic teaching tool for churches and groups who desire to explore their Jewish heritage found in Christ. Believers will also find the observance of the feasts and holidays as a meaningful way to add depth to their devotional studies.</p><p>Sam Nadler is one of today's most solid Messianic Jewish teachers. He brings fascinating insights without losing sight of major scriptural truths. He is doctrinally sound and yet calls for Christians to look afresh for new discoveries the Word. And he demonstrates with undeniable clarity how the Feasts and Holy Days of Israel are of importance to the Church today, indeed, how they are ultimately witnesses to Yeshua the Messiah. If you're looking for practical, edifying, and enlightened teaching on this important topic, look no further. --Dr. Michael L. Brown, author, Answering Jewish Objections to Jesus<br><br>I am greatly impressed with how well written, visually appealing and coordinated the DVD, PowerPoint, Book, Leaders and Participants guide along with the Pamphlet are.

Too often treated as a preamble to polyphony, this music forms the basis of Europe&#39;s musical tradition. (A companion volume by F. A. Gallo, forthcoming in English translation, covers polyphonic music of the Middle Ages.) Giulio Cattin outlines the birth and evolution of Christian chant in the early centuries of the Church and describes a number of partly independent Byzantine and Western chant traditions. Fr Cattin&#39;s own background in the Church gives a particular authority to his writing on liturgical music, and he presents the latest original research without being too technical. In addition to offshoots of the main liturgical tradition such as tropes, metrical offices and liturigical drama, Fr Cattin covers the birth of secular music, first in Latin monody, and then in a growing variety of music in vernacular languages - the Italian laude and the lyrics of the Proven�al troubadours, the French trouv�res and the German Minnesinger. Chapters on early instrumental music and on the philosopher&#39;s view of the ars musica complete the book.</p><p>Starting with the chant of the Jewish temple and synagogue, the text outlines the birth and evolution of Christian chant and the liturgical framework within which the music developed in the early centuries of the Church. It also explores the birth of secular music in Latin monody and other vernacular languages.Steven Botterill is Associate Professor of Italian Studies, University of California, Berkeley.</p><h2>Foundations of Therapeutic Recreation</h2><p><p>Through <i>Foundations of Therapeutic Recreation</i>, students will be able to achieve these objectives:</p><p>-Gain a 21st-century vision of the profession provided by leading thinkers in the field</p><p>-Learn the attributes and skills they need in order to thrive in various career paths in the profession</p><p>-Interact through the text, technology, and media responses to more thoroughly understand the field and profession</p><p><i>Foundations of Therapeutic Recreation</i> provides readers with a comprehensive introduction to the profession.

Translated by Jan Steenbrink and Henry Jansen. Second Revised Edition. ... 7) (Currents of Encounter Series, 7)</h2><p>This book tells the story of the contacts and conflicts between muslims and christians in Southeast Asia during the Dutch colonial history from 1596 until 1950. The author draws from a great variety of sources to shed light on this period: the letters of the colonial pioneer Jan Pietersz. Coen, the writings of 17th century Dutch theologians, the minutes of the Batavia church council, the contracts of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) with the sultans in the Indies, documents from the files of colonial civil servants from the 19th and 20th centuries, to mention just a few. The colonial situation was not a good starting-point for a religious dialogue. With Dutch power on the increase there was even less understanding for the religion of the muslims . In 1620 J.P. Coen, the strait-laced calvinist, had actually a better understanding and respect for the muslims than the liberal colonial leaders from the early 20th century, convinced as they were of western supremacy. Dr. Steenbrink (b. 1942) studied christian theology and islam at the university of Nijmegen. In 1970-1971 he was a student at an Islamic training-college in Indonesia. He was the first non-muslim to hold a teaching post at the State Academies of Islamic Studies of Jakarta and Yogyakarta from 1981 until 1988. At present he is a member of the staff of the Interuniversity Institute for Missiological and Ecumenical Research (IIMO) at Leyden. In addition he is the chief editor of the magazine BEGRIP (Understanding) which aims at improving relations between christians and muslims. Twenty years of intensive contacts with muslims have taught him that improving these relations is no simple matter which can be tackled lightheartedly. Yet he also projected the starting-points for an islamic-christian theological study group. In the concluding chapters of this book he outlines some historic and at the same time topical backgrounds for the need for such a theological study group. Contents: Forward By Dr. H.

For the first time in Spain, France, England and Germany the luxury of thinking and learning ceased to be the limited preserve of the higher echelons of the Church and the Court. The effect, the author shows, was to bring about an irreversible shift in European culture.<br> This intellectual history of medieval Europe (translated from the revised French edition of 1984) will be widely welcomed by students and scholars of the Middle Ages throughout the English-speaking world.<b>Jacques Le Goff</b> is one of France's most well known and respected historians. He is author of <i>Medieval Civilization</i>. He was awarded the CNRS Gold Medal, one of France's most prestigious intellectual prizes in 1991 - the first historian ever to have won. He is also general editor of the <i>Making of Europe</i> series, the first titles in which will be published in 1993.</p><h2>Does God Control Everything? (Crucial Questions)</h2><p><p>Many people today believe that, even if there is a God, He is not actively involved in this world.

Sproul explores the Christian doctrine of providence, the teaching that God is the sovereign Ruler of the universe. Dr. Sproul then answers some common questions: What is chance? Is God responsible for human wickedness? What about human freedom?</p><p>The Crucial Questions booklet series by Dr. R.C.

B. Yeats)</h2><p>Collects all of the Nobel laureate&#39;s published work and includes additional notes and criticisms.</p><p>William Butler Yeats, whom many consider this century's greatest poet, began as a bard of the Celtic Twilight, reviving legends and Rosicrucian symbols. By the early 1900s, however, he was moving away from plush romanticism, his verse morphing from the incantatory rhythms of "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree" into lyrics "as cold and passionate as the dawn." At every stage, however, Yeats plays a multiplicity of poetic roles. There is the romantic lover of "When You Are Old" and "A Poet to His Beloved" ("I bring you with reverent Hands / The books of my numberless dreams..."). And there are the far more bitter celebrations of Maud Gonne, who never accepted his love and engaged in too much politicking for his taste: "Why should I blame her that she filled my days / With misery, or that she would of late / Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways, / Or hurled the little streets upon the great, / Had they but courage equal to desire?" There is also the poet of conscience--and confrontation. His 1931 "Remorse for Intemperate Speech" ends: "Out of Ireland have we come. / Great hatred, little room, / Maimed us at the start. / I carried from my mother's womb / A fanatic heart." <p> Yeats was to explore several more sides of himself, and of Ireland, before his <i>Last Poems</i> of 1938-39. Many are difficult, some snobbish, others occult and spiritualist. As Brendan Kennelly writes, Yeats "produces both poppycock and sublimity in verse, sometimes closely together." On the other hand, many prophetic masterworks are poppycock-free--for example, "The Second Coming" ("Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world...") and such inquiries into inspiration as "Among School Children" ("O body swayed to music, O brightening glance, How can we know the dancer from the dance?"). And at his best, Yeats extends the meaning of love poetry beyond the obviously romantic: love becomes a revolutionary emotion, attaching the poet to friends, history, and the passionate life of the mind. </p> <p> Though this edition has been reset and revised, the changes are not as shocking as the 1984 edition, which included 100 extra pages of notes, changes in language and punctuation, and, most significantly, a redefinition of the <i>Last Poems</i>. Richard Finneran has had the courage to reorder the poems according to notes that Yeats made shortly before his death. Readers may be surprised to find that "Under Ben Bulben," the poet's powerful and self-mythologizing epitaph, no longer ends the collection, as it has for more than 30 years. In its place they will discover the wistful "Politics": "How can I, that girl standing there, / My attention fix / On Roman or on Russian / Or on Spanish politics..." Yet devotees of either ending will agree that this is a truly <i>necessary</i> volume--indeed, one of the few. As Seamus Heaney writes, "All readers of Yeats will need this book; when they open it they will feel a surprise like that experienced by St. Brendan the Navigator and his crew when they disembarked upon an island that turned out to be the back of a dormant sea monster."</p>The late <b>Richard J. Finneran</b> was general editor, with George Mills Harper, of <i>The Collected Works of W. B. Yeats</i> for many years; series editor of <i>The Poems</i> in the Cornell Yeats; and editor of <i>Yeats: An Annual of Critical and Textual Studies,</i> among other works. He held the Hodges Chair of Excellence at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; was a past president of the South Atlantic Modern Language Association; and served as executive director of the Society for Textual Scholarship.</p><h2>21 Unbreakable Laws of Life</h2><p>Life is often compared to a jungle.with good reason.

Introduction by Garry Wills. Translated by Stephen Rendall.<br></p><p><i>The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI</i> by Georges Passelecq and Bernard Suchecky is about "a bungled effort at compassion"--one of the most important Catholic documents of the 20th century, which was intended to denounce Hitler's anti-Semitism but was never completed. The reasons for this document's commission and suppression, as described by Passelecq and Suchecky, compose a scandalous indictment of Italian church-and-state relations. When Pius XI accepted a stark separation of church and state in the 1930s, he effectively undermined Catholic political groups, an act which eased the rise of European dictators and led to World War II. <i>The Hidden Encyclical</i> is suitably critical of Pius without lapsing into Vatican bashing. It's a sober, rueful, and straightforward story about the tragic cost of exalting Truth over love. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Georges Passelecq, a Benedictine monk, was a member of the Belgian Resistance in World War II.</p><h2>Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications</h2><p>This richly illustrated textbook provides a clear, balanced and modern approach to quantum mechanics.

From our Paleolithic past to our digitised present, every continent and culture is covered in an articulate and well-balanced discussion--a broad and epic canvas that omits none of the fine detail. In this Revised Seventh Edition, contemporary art historian Michael Archer has brought the account of contemporary art up to date, reflecting the latest developments that continue to shape out cultural history.</p><p>Hugh Honour is one of the leading art historians of the 20th century. He is co-author with Nikolaus Pevsner and John Fleming of <em>The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture</em>.<br><br>John Fleming founded and edited with Hugh Honour the Pelican <em>Style and Civilization</em> series. He died in 2001.Originally published in 2009, this most recent edition of Honour and Fleming&#x2019;s classic art-history text is now being marketed to a general audience at a more affordable price. With a chronology that stretches from prehistory to the present day in nearly 1,000 pages and 1,500 color and black-and-white images images, this book aims to be comprehensive, as befitting its stated goal of being &#x201c;exploratory rather than critical.&#x201d; Photography, architecture, and digital and installation art are discussed, along with traditional media, such as painting and sculpture. Unlike many art-history books, the focus here goes beyond Western art, and topics such as colonialism and indigenous art are addressed within the chronological organization rather than in separate sections or volumes. Also notable is the attention devoted to contemporary art. The final chapter, &#x201c;Into the Third Millennium,&#x201d; focuses on art from the 1980s to the early 2010s. Contributed by contemporary art historian Michael Archer, the chapter addresses recent developments from a global perspective, including sections on &#x201c;Postmodern Multiculturalism&#x201d; and &#x201c;Globalization, Sensation, and Spectacle.&#x201d; Each chapter begins with a time line that juxtaposes historical landmarks with events in the visual arts. &#x201c;In Context,&#x201d; &#x201c;Urban Development,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sources and Documents&#x201d; boxes provide historical, religious, and cultural context and excerpts from relevant primary source documents. The book also includes a glossary, lists of further reading for each chapter, and an index. Classic art-history surveys are regularly updated but often at a significantly higher cost. At just $75, this book represents an affordable and comprehensive addition to academic, school, and public library collections. --Lindsay Harmon</p><h2>Gadamer: Hermeneutics, Tradition, and Reason (Key Contemporary Thinkers)</h2><p>Hans-Georg Gadamer is one of the leading philosophers in the world today. Since the publication in 1960 of his magnum opus <i>Truth and Method</i>, his philosophical hermeneutics has been the focus of a great deal of attention and controversy. His ideas have been applied to questions of interpretation in the study of art and literature, to issues of knowledge and objectivity in the social sciences, and even to reevaluations of philosophy itself. This book is a systematic introduction to Gadamer's work, presented with a clarity of exposition and argument that makes it rewarding to non-philosophers and philosophers alike. It is constructed around a series of debates on historicism, authorial intention, subjectivism, ideology, and the "New Pragmatism," and it pays particular attention to how Gadamer's work has been interpreted and criticized by such philosophers as Hirsch, Habermas, Apel, and Rorty. The dialogic form, which is in itself a central feature of hermeneutic theory, gives the book an immediacy that textual exegesis cannot achieve. This is the first book in the series, Key Contemporary Thinkers, which will make available the ideas of some of the most influential philosophers of our time. The series will cut across academic disciplines and will include books on European, British, and American thinkers.</p><p>Hans-Georg Gadamer is one of the leading philosophers in the world today.

Sometimes thinking outside of the box can add that something extra to your photos that makes people take notice. <br><br> In the first image with the barber pole that I shot on South Congress Avenue in Austin Texas, I mixed different shapes, leading lines going in multiple directions, and opposing colors to make an odd combination that adds a wacky element to the image, which makes it a little more intriguing. The image was shot with a Nikon 35mm f/1.4 lens with the camera settings of 1/2000 at f/1.4 and ISO 100. <br><br> The second image is a praying mantis that I found hanging around in a bush in my backyard. I used backlighting to silhouette the insect for an almost ominous effect that adds to the odd alien-like features of the mantis. In addition, I used a technique that's very common in photography that is called framing. This is where you use elements from the scene to surround the main subject to make it stand out even more. Using the background foliage to create a dark frame around the background of the insect, which is extra bright, really draws attention to the main subject. For this shot, I used a Nikon 85mm f/3.5 VR macro lens with the camera settings of 1/160 @ f/18 and ISO 1600. <br><br> In this third image of a Boston Terrier named Clementine, I used a bit of backlighting, but the main technique is getting down and shooting from a low angle. Being bipedal and much taller than dogs, we humans tend to look down on them and when we take photographs, oftentimes we continue this trend. Looking up at a dog isnâ�&#x201a;��&#x201e;�t the norm so it adds something interesting to the photo. The Vari-angle LCD of the D5100 is a real help when framing shots like this! The other thing that I did to make the image more interesting was using wide-angle perspective distortion and an odd angle to add a little tension to the shot. This photo was taken with a Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 OS with the camera settings of 1/30 @ f/2.8 and ISO 400. <br><br> Keep your mind and eyes open, break some rules, and make your images a little off-kilter to keep things fresh! <br> <b>From the Author: Top 5 accessories for the D5100 </b><br><br> 1. <b>Nikon ME-1 Stereo Microphone</b>: Although the inclusion of full-time AF on Nikon HDSLRs was a great feature, there was one very obvious problem, the on-camera mic picked up the noise of the lens autofocusing. The only way to combat this problem is to get the mic up and away from the lens. Nikon's new ME-1 microphone mounts right in the hot-shoe and allows you to record video without the noise of the AF system working. Another big plus is that unlike the built-in mic, the ME-1 records in stereo! <br><br> 2. <b>SanDisk Extreme Pro SDHC UHS-1</b>: If you're going to be shooting video or stills at a high burst rate, you need a fast card. This is the fastest SD card on the market. Available in 8, 16, or 32GB. Not only do these cards speed up your shooting process, they make downloading to your computer lightning fast as well. <br><br> 3. <b>NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G</b>: This is by far the coolest lens to have in your bag. The fast aperture makes it awesome for shooting in low-light and great for artistic shallow depth of field shots. It weighs almost nothing making it a snap to carry, and the price is just the icing on the cake, at just around $200 there is no better lens you can get for the D5100. <br><br> 4. <b>Black Rapid RS-4 strap</b>: In my opinion these are the only straps to have. The Black Rapid slings over your shoulder, letting the camera hang by your side. You can quickly grab it, slide it up the nylon strap and be ready to shoot in seconds. Unlike traditional straps, the camera weight isn't on your neck, which can create tension headaches and neck strain. This is the slickest and most comfortable strap on the market. <br><br> 5. <b>Naneu Pro Military Ops Echo X camera bag</b>: If you're looking for a comfortable camera bag with easy access, look no further. This is a messenger style bag that allows you to slide it around and quickly grab your camera. The Echo X is styled so that it doesn't look like a camera bag, which is perfect if you're worried about being targeted by thieves. These bags are heavy duty and come with a lifetime warranty. The one time I had a problem with a Naneu Pro bag the quickly shipped me a replacement strap. A very stand-up company. They make a complete line of camera and laptop bags.

S. Bach the man and composer. Benefiting from the insights and research of some of the most distinguished Bach scholars, this Companion covers cultural, social and religious contexts, surveys and analyzes Bach&#39;s compositional style, traces his influence, and considers the performance and reception of his music through the succeeding generations.</p><p>Fifteen varied essays by 11 authors provide a thoughtful, broad introduction to the music and person of Johann Sebastian Bach. <i>The Cambridge Companion</i> is divided into three main sections: the first concentrates on the biographical and historical details of Bach's life; the second aims at a general discussion of the music; and the last evaluates Bach's continuing influence on modern music. Representative topics in each section include a recounting of Bach's position as a supporter of monarchical absolutism ("Bach and the Domestic Politics of Electoral Saxony"), a discussion of scholarship throwing light on the authenticity of some of the early works ("The Early Works and the Heritage of the Seventeenth Century"), and an outline of developments in performance practice of Bach's music from his time to ours ("Changing Issues of Performance Practice"). The book provides valuable background material for those who may have casually encountered and enjoyed Bach's music, and the variety of viewpoints helps readers avoid an oversimplified impression of the great composer.'This present collection of essays is far from being a rehash of what is already easily accessible in other sources, but sheds new light on known facts or, better still, unearths new ones ... unreservedly recommended for serious music libraries.'

In The Jewel of Abundance, award-winning author and Kriya Yoga teacher Ellen Grace O'Brian reveals an overlooked aspect of yoga: its powerful teachings on prosperity. She draws upon the ancient Vedic tradition of yoga philosophy and practice and shows how spirituality and earthly success can complement each other, leading to realization of the higher Self. O'Brian presents a clear explanation of both the philosophy of yoga and the nuts and bolts of practice, such as setting up a daily meditation routine, incorporating mantras, discerning how to cooperate with universal principles for complete well-being, and cultivating mindfulness in action.<br> <br> Along the way, she illustrates her lessons with personal stories and timeless sayings from great sages, both Eastern and Western. With O'Brian's insightful guidance, readers will discover an inexhaustible source of abundance that is available to them whenever they look within.<br>&nbsp; <b>BOOK AWARDS:</b><ul><li>Nautilus Books Awards: Silver Medal Awardee of the 2019</li><li>Next Generation Indie Books Awards Finalist of the 2019</li><li>Foreword Indies Book Award Finalist of the 2018</li></ul></p><p><b>Ellen Grace O'Brian </b>is a <i>yogacharya </i>(an esteemed yoga teacher), an award-winning writer and poet who weaves poetry into her teachings on spiritual matters, the spiritual director of the Center for Spiritual Enlightenment in San Jose, California, and&nbsp;a host of The Yoga Hour podcast.&nbsp;Ordained by Roy Eugene Davis, a direct disciple of Paramahansa Yogananda, she has been teaching Kriya Yoga philosophy and practice nationally and internationally for over three decades.&#x201c;Yoga is the science of the self. It is a practical science that validates the knowledge that the self of the individual is the self of the universe. When you are one with the Source of existence, you are one with infinite abundance and with the unlimited potential of all manifestation. This jewel of a book will show you how to tap into your inner intelligence, the ultimate and supreme genius that mirrors the wisdom of the cosmos. Cultivate wealth consciousness, and affluence and prosperity will effortlessly flow toward you in all their manifestations.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Deepak Chopra,</strong> bestselling author of <em>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success </em>and <em>You Are the Universe<br> </em><br> &#x201c;<em>The Jewel of Abundance</em> will inspire, challenge, and motivate readers to discover and express their innate potential to experience excellence in all aspects of life. Having known Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian for almost four decades, I am pleased to affirm her good character and total commitment to living the principles she so clearly explains.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Roy Eugene Davis, </strong>founder and director of Center for Spiritual Awareness and author of <em>Paramahansa Yogananda as I Knew Him</em><br> <br> &#x201c;<em>The Jewel of Abundance</em> lays out a well-defined perspective on prosperity, wealth, and abundance. It presents a balanced view that takes into account common human needs and shows us simple ways to find happiness and satisfaction that lie beyond the accumulation of material objects. Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian carefully and simply presents ancient wisdom so that one can easily begin to make the necessary changes to one&#x2019;s lifestyle. One does not have to be a saint to follow the path of righteousness; one simply has to learn the ways of dharma, kama, and artha and apply them to one&#x2019;s daily life. <em>The Jewel of Abundance</em> is a very valuable book containing gems of wisdom. It can help the world change its course from the present crisis of materialism to a sustainable lifestyle.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Ela Gandhi,</strong> peace activist and founder of the Gandhi Development Trust<br> <br> &#x201c;A perennial issue for professional yoga teachers and therapists is the perceived tension between the need for reasonable material prosperity and the desire for spiritual growth. Hence, <em>The</em> <em>Jewel of Abundance</em> is a timely, practical, and indeed inspiring guide for reconciling these conflicts based on the classic teachings of the purusharthas &#x2014; the four aims of human life &#x2014; and many other timeless lessons from the yoga tradition. As Yogacharya Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian says, &#x2018;Prosperity provides the means to fulfill our divine potential; it&#x2019;s the vehicle for the divine dream to manifest.&#x2019; She writes paragraphs that are jewels in their own right. Thus my advice is to read as I did &#x2014; slowly, to allow the time required to savor and reflect on her wisdom. Do her suggested practices. You will find yourself refreshed and renewed in both your work and your spirit.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; John Kepner, </strong>MA (Econ), MBA, C-IAYT, executive director of the International Association of Yoga Therapists<br> <br> &#x201c;Wealth (artha) is a difficult and yet necessary topic for all to contemplate, as we live in a world of greed, competition, and selfishness motivated by scarcity and desires. Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian has dived to the depths of the soul to transform our fears into courage and our sense of lack into our joy of abundance. She not only enlightens the reader about what true abundance is but also reassures the reader that it is reachable step-by-step. <em>The Jewel of Abundance</em> is accessible to a vast audience with transparent, graceful, and wise words.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Swami Sitaramananda, </strong>acharya of International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers<br> <br> &#x201c;To live well is to thrive physically, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually. But how? Most self-help books focus on one of these factors, often at the expense of the other three. Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s <em>The Jewel of Abundance</em> recognizes the interdependence of all four. That&#x2019;s because this is not a self-help book, but a <em>Self</em>-help book: a manual for liberating the soul that optimizes body, heart, mind, and spirit as well. Please don&#x2019;t read this book. Practice it.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Rabbi Rami Shapiro, </strong>author of <em>Perennial Wisdom for the Spiritually Independent<br> </em><br> &#x201c;Many of us aspire to purpose, and perhaps even enlightenment, in our lifetimes, but few realize that the path leads through prosperity and pleasure as equally important steps on the journey. Ellen Grace O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s clear and compelling words bring unique perspective to wisdom from ancient teachings, in language that is even more powerful today.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Scott Kriens, </strong>chairman and former CEO of Juniper Networks and cofounder of 1440 Multiversity<br> <br> &#x201c;Gaining true prosperity rests upon understanding our karmas and fulfilling our dharma, or soul&#x2019;s purpose. Then we can achieve the outer success we need while continuing to progress along our spiritual path.

Divided into three sections: methods for diagnosing fish diseases, problem list, and methods for treating fish diseases, the book will guide the reader through the most commonly encountered fish diseases and provide the knowledge to manage those diseases effectively. It can be used by people engaged in fish culture and husbandry, as well as fish diagnostics, research, or teaching.</p><p>There are many organisms and clinical manifestations of fish disease that the practitioner does not encounter in other areas of veterinary practice.

The first section of the book describes the flood tide of European expansion that began in the 16th century and united the world for the first time in a single economic strategic, and political unit. The second section analyzes the process whereby the non-European states came to take their place as members of the same society, while the third section examines the repudiation of European, Russian, and American domination by states and peoples of the Third World, and the subsequent transition from a system based on European hegemony to one that is not. The book concludes with a discussion of the international order that has emerged from the ebb tide of European dominance.</p><p><br>b is dead<br></p><h2>School Leadership and Administration: Important Concepts, Case Studies, and Simulations</h2><p>This text helps prospective and experienced principals, administrators, and supervisors increase their knowledge and skills through concepts, case-studies, and simulations.

It is normally treated as a collection of sagas about Norwegian kings, but there is no evidence that Snorri planned such an arrangement. Indeed, in his preface Snorri described the book as an account of &#x2018;chieftains who had dominium in the North and were speakers of the Danish tongue,&#x2019; that is, not only kings but others &#x2018;of exalted lineage.&#x2019; Some of these chieftains and their kin figure more prominently and are judged more favourably by Snorri than most kings. Moreover, most of the conflicts described by Snorri were not between individuals but involved their families and adherents, including women who often have important and active roles, and sometimes apparently express Snorri&#x2019;s own views.&nbsp;</p><p>The main conclusion of this study is that Snorri &#x2014; who was himself a chieftain (<i>go�i) &#x2014; </i>wrote <i>Heimskringla</i> during the reign of H�kon H�konsson (1217&#x2013;1263) to criticize the development of the central power of king and church at the expense of the traditional authority of chieftains. A comparison with <i>Gesta Danorum</i> by Snorri&#x2019;s Danish contemporary Saxo Grammaticus, shows that they were both masters of the art of ambiguity. The fact that a fine copy <i>Heimskringla</i> was made <i>c</i>. 1260 may imply that it contained much that was approved by King H�kon&#x2019;s opponents.</p></p><p><p>Birgit Sawyer is professor emeritus in medieval history at the University of Trondheim (NTNU), Norway.

Whitehead explores Davis's worldviews and politics, her perceptions of both public and private events, her personal relationships, and her place in Philadelphia's free black community in the nineteenth century.<br>Although Davis's daily entries are sparse, brief snapshots of her life, Whitehead interprets them in ways that situate Davis in historical and literary contexts that illuminate nineteenth-century black American women's experiences. Whitehead's contribution of edited text and original narrative fills a void in scholarly documentation of women who dwelled in spaces between white elites, black entrepreneurs, and urban dwellers of every race and class.<br>Notes from a Colored Girl is a unique offering to the fields of history and documentary editing as the book includes both a six-chapter historical reconstruction of Davis's life and a full, heavily annotated edition of her Civil War-era pocket diaries. Drawing on scholarly traditions from history, literature, feminist studies, and sociolinguistics, Whitehead investigates Davis's diary both as a complete literary artifact and in terms of her specific daily entries.<br>From a historical perspective, Whitehead re-creates the narrative of Davis's life for those three years and analyzes the black community where she lived and worked. From a literary perspective, Whitehead examines Davis's diary as a socially, racially, and gendered nonfiction text. From a feminist studies perspective, she examines Davis's agency and identity, grounded in theories elaborated by black feminist scholars. And, from linguistic and rhetorical perspectives, she studies Davis's discourse about her interpersonal relationships, her work, and external events in her life in an effort to understand how she used language to construct her social, racial, and gendered identities.<br>Since there are few primary sources written by black women during this time in history, Davis's diary&#x2015;though ordinary in its content&#x2015;is rendered extraordinary simply because it has survived to be included in this very small class of resources. Whitehead's extensive analysis illuminates the lives of many through the simple words of one.</p><p>Karsonya (Kaye) Wise Whitehead is an assistant professor of communication and African and African American Studies in the Department of Communication at Loyola University Maryland; a Master Teacher in African American history; an award-winning former Baltimore City middle school teacher; a curriculum writer and lesson plan developer; and, a three-time New York Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker.

As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Last of the Mohicans (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series)</h2><p><i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, by <b>James Fenimore Cooper</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

With its death-defying chases and teeth-clenching suspense, this American classic established many archetypes of American frontier fiction.</p><p>An engrossing Western&#x201d; by America&#x2019;s first great novelist, <i>The Last of the Mohicans </i>is a story of survival and treachery, love and deliverance.</p><b>Stephen Railton</b>, Professor of English at the University of Virginia, has written books on Cooper, Mark Twain, and the American Renaissance, and has created major websites on Twain, <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>, and American culture.</p><p><b>Stephen Railton</b>, Professor of English at the University of Virginia, has written books on Cooper, Mark Twain, and the American Renaissance, and has created major websites on Twain, <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>, and American culture.<b>From Stephen Railton's Introduction to <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i></b><p>We must not fall for the fiction Cooper uses to organize the story he tells in <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>. There has never been a last&#x201d; Mohican. The tribe Cooper refers to by that name survives to this day, on a small reservation in Wisconsin. According to Cooper&#x2019;s version of the Mohicans&#x2019; story, the death of Uncas in the middle of the eighteenth century is the last act in the tragedy of a once-mighty nation. There are a number of tragic elements in the real history of the people who, when they learned to write English, referred to themselves as the Muhheakunnuk or Moheakunnuk, but the story they have written with their actions is that of a people who, while remaining true to key elements of their heritage, made great efforts to adapt to and earn a place in the new world that descended on them with the arrival of the traders and settlers from Europe.</p><p>As Patrick Frazier recounts that story in <i>The Mohicans of Stockbridge</i>, the tribe accepted Christianity about two decades before the events Cooper dramatizes in the novel; two decades after the supposed death of the last Mohican, they fought on the American side during the Revolutionary War. When the tribe relocated from Massachusetts to the vicinity of New York&#x2019;s Oneida Lake in the mid-1780s, just a few years before the infant James Cooper was carried to Cooperstown on the banks of nearby Lake Otsego, they took with them a letter from George Washington attesting that the Muhheakunnuks have fought and bled by our side . . . as our friends and brothers . . . [and] as friends and subjects to the United States of America.&#x201d; No efforts could stop the tide of white pioneers from diminishing their population and driving them farther west, but like nearly all the original Native American tribes, they survived despite the centuries of cultural loss, economic dispossession, white aggression, discrimination, and neglect.</p><p>That true story, however, is one the United States is still reluctant to tell, and repressed almost completely throughout the nineteenth century as the pioneers moved westward across the continent. On the other hand, Americans loved the story Cooper tells in Mohicans. Published in 1826, it was Cooper&#x2019;s sixth novel; he was already America&#x2019;s most successful novelist, a position he held through most of his career, and among the thirty-two novels he wound up writing before his death in 1851 were a number of best-sellers. <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> was first among them all: his most popular book, and one of the most widely read American novels ever. Like most of Cooper&#x2019;s novels, especially those he wrote in the first half of his career, it derives from the model of the historical romance that Walter Scott established in <i>Waverley</i> (1814). The subtitle of Cooper&#x2019;s novel <i>A Narrative of 1757</i> echoes <i>Waverley</i>&#x2019;s subtitle, <i>&#x2019;Tis Sixty Years Since</i>, and in his preface to the book&#x2019;s first edition Cooper warns mere novel readers that by narrative&#x201d; he means historical fact, not imaginative fancy. But the project of <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i> is myth making, not history writing, and the myth it makes served contemporary readers precisely by replacing history as the nation was enacting it with a story about the fate of the Indians that both moved and reassured the whites who were in fact (but not in Cooper&#x2019;s fiction) the agents of that fate.</p><p>As Cooper tells the story, the first person to label Uncas the last of the Mohicans&#x201d; is actually his own father. Chingachgook himself is still a vigorous warrior, and the narrative repeatedly refers to Uncas as young&#x201d; and youthful&#x201d; that such a father would be anticipating the death of such a son rather then looking forward to his eventual marriage and children seems to violate the truths of the human heart, but as Cooper tells the story, even Uncas accepts his ominous title. In fact, he enters the narrative exactly at the moment in chapter III when Chingachgook tells Hawkeye that when Uncas dies the whole tribe will be extinct, for my boy is the last of the Mohicans.&#x201d; Uncas is here!&#x201d; is the next line, as a youthful warrior&#x201d; steps out of the woods to join the conversation. Here,&#x201d; this introduction to him implies, but not for long&#x201d; Uncas will figure throughout the novel as a character with an expiration date. As a rescuer of the story&#x2019;s two white heroines and as the lost prince of the Delaware nation, Uncas is regarded by both the narrator and the white characters with considerable admiration. His head may be naked except for its scalping tuft,&#x201d; but the narrative calls it noble.&#x201d; Alice looks upon him as a heathen, a being partially benighted in the vale of ignorance,&#x201d; but she also associates his graceful,&#x201d; dignified,&#x201d; pure,&#x201d; and proud&#x201d; form with classical ideals, some precious relic of the Grecian chisel.&#x201d; Cora goes further: Who that looks at this creature of nature, remembers the shade of his skin!&#x201d; To her, that&#x2019;s a rhetorical question, but her companions&#x2019; short and embarrassed silence&#x201d; in reply keeps the line between races firmly in place. Combined with the epithet the last,&#x201d; that racial boundary lets readers know that all the sympathetic admiration they bestow on Uncas is extended provisionally. Within those limits, the narrative allows Uncas to grow increasingly heroic. After the first rescue scene, for example, while his father scalps the Mingoes they&#x2019;ve slain, Uncas hurries with Duncan, the white officer and gentleman, to the side of the two white maidens. Duncan is not ashamed to cry at the sight of their deliverance. Uncas doesn&#x2019;t go that far, but his eyes nonetheless beam with a sympathy that elevated him far above the intelligence and advanced him probably centuries before the practices of his nation.&#x201d;</p><p>While that sentence doubtless sounds patronizing, if not racist, to most twenty-first century readers, Cooper&#x2019;s books display more respect and admiration for Indian characters like Uncas than was the norm in his culture. Indeed, his depiction of Uncas as so noble a savage came under attack from a number of critics. A novel like Robert Montgomery Bird&#x2019;s <i>Nick of the Woods</i> (1837), also a best-seller, was written expressly to contest Cooper&#x2019;s poetical illusions&#x201d; and beautiful unrealities&#x201d; by describing instead what Bird in his preface calls real Indians,&#x201d; who are unrelievedly ignorant, violent, debased, brutal.&#x201d; Mark Twain made the same argument in <i>Roughing It</i> (1872), and began a sequel to <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> (1885) that takes Huck and Tom into the Indian Territory so he can debunk Cooper&#x2019;s romances by exposing the boys to a series of atrocities committed by treacherous Indians. In 1851, shortly before Cooper&#x2019;s death, the Chippewa chief and activist George Copway publicly thanked the novelist for having created Uncas as a hero&#x201d; who possesses all the noble traits of an exalted character,&#x201d; an Indian whom Native Americans could read about with pride. Yet although Cooper advances Uncas centuries ahead of his tribesmen, he is careful never to suggest that the last Mohican could progress to the point where he belongs inside American civilization. He lifts Uncas high enough to make his passing tragic but readers mourn for him at the end, as they admire him throughout, from within the safety of a world out of which he has already disappeared.</p></p><h2>Research Primer For The Helping Professions: Methods, Statistics, and Writings</h2><p>This applied text presents an overview of the research process appropriate for a first course in research methods and as a refresher for more advanced students.

Those essays, known today as the <em>Federalist Papers</em>, explain the philosophical basis of the Constitution and defend the idea of republican government against charges that it would lead to tyranny.<br><br> Today's political controversies call into question some of the principles that have shaped government through most of this century. <em>New Federalist Papers</em>, written by three constitutional experts, defends the representative democracy put in place by the framers of the Constitution. Like Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, the authors of <em>New Federalist Papers</em> see danger in the effort to diminish and relocate federal power. They recognize that it is the task of public discourse to bring about reasoned consideration of such issues as gun control, term limits, flag burning, the balanced budget amendment, and campaign finance reform.</p><p>To hear many modern politicians tell it, the federal government is the worst thing that ever happened to the American people. Federal laws and mandates are portrayed as tyrannical, new amendments to the Constitution are proposed with frightening regularity, and "states' rights" has become the latest rallying cry for "patriots" everywhere. In response to this discontent, the 20th Century Fund commissioned <i>New Federalist Papers</i>, a collection of essays in defense of the Constitution. The three authors, Alan Brinkley, Kathleen M. Sullivan, and Nelson W. Polsby, are all academics--Brinkley teaches history at Columbia, Sullivan is a law professor at Stanford, and Polsby teaches political science at Berkeley--and each approaches the Consititution from his or her particular field of study. Brinkley examines the history of the federal government, which was formed precisely to guard <i>against</i> the tyranny smaller entities such as the states could impose, then points out how far the American people have strayed from the assumptions underlying the Constitution: a well-informed, civic-minded public that takes seriously its responsibility to vote. Polsby points out how well they've managed to govern such a large and disparate territory, while Sullivan explores current attempts to impose new policies through Constitutional amendment, using the miserable failure of the Prohibition amendment as a cautionary tale. <p> In an era when the majority of Americans receive their news in sound bites and the solution to every problem is a facile cry to dismantle the government, <i>New Federalist Papers</i> is a refreshing return to the principles on which the country was founded, most of which have been misinterpreted, misconstrued, or just plain misunderstood somewhere along the way; after all, citizens should understand what they've got before they decide to throw it away.</p><p><strong>Alan Brinkley</strong> is professor of history at Columbia University and author of numerous books, including <em>The End of Reform</em>.</p><p><strong>Nelson W.

Some 7,000 men and women were executed on public scaffolds then, watched by crowds of thousands. Hanging was confined to murderers thereafter, but these were still killed in public until 1868. Clearly the gallows loomed over much of social life in this period. But how did those who watched, read about, or ordered these strangulations feel about the terror and suffering inflicted in the law&#39;s name? What kind of justice was delivered, and how did it change? This book is the first to explore what a wide range of people felt about these ceremonies (rather than what a few famous men thought and wrote about them). A history of mentalities, emotions, and attitudes rather than of policies and ideas, it analyses responses to the scaffold at all social levels: among the crowds which gathered to watch executions; among &#39;polite&#39; commentators from Boswell and Byron on to Fry, Thackeray, and Dickens; and among the judges, home secretary, and monarch who decided who should hang and who should be reprieved. Drawing on letters, diaries, ballads, broadsides, and images, as well as on poignant appeals for mercy which historians until now have barely explored, the book surveys changing attitudes to death and suffering, &#39;sensibility&#39; and &#39;sympathy&#39;, and demonstrates that the long retreat from public hanging owed less to the growth of a humane sensibility than to the development of new methods of punishment and law enforcement, and to polite classes&#39; deepening squeamishness and fear of the scaffold crowd. This gripping study is essential reading for anyone interested in the processes whichhave &#39;civilized&#39; our social life. Challenging many conventional understandings of the period, V. A. C.

This catalog, published in conjunction with the major retrospective at the Lugano Museum of Modern Art, provides an excellent overview of Basquiat's life and work. As an African-American painter, Basquiat has made a significant impact on the history of contemporary art. From his origins as a street graffiti artist, he became one of the most influential artists of his time: in 2005 his work is being celebrated in seperate exhibitions in the US and Europe. As emblems of the contemporary world, his explosive, colorful, and apparently na�f canvases have an unparalleled force. The brief but intense artistic career of this celebrated proponent of the downtown New York art scene of the 1980s is covered through some fifty paintings and twenty works on paper drawn from prestigious private collections and museums. This book offers a new intense dialogue with the more modern expressions of twentieth-century art.</p></p><p><p>Rudy Chiappini is Director of the Lugano Modern Art Museum.</p>Emerging from New York's 1970s counterculture, Jean-Michel Basquiat conquered the mainstream art world in 1981, when an <i>Artforum</i> profile by Ren� Ricard dubbed him the love child of Cy Twombly and Jean Dubuffet. Basquiat brought with him a visual lexicon of graffiti symbols and urban rage&#x2014;an artistic style that many critics of the day deemed more eye-sore than art form. Chiappini's study of Basquiat's work, which spans the artist's career from his earliest SoHo shows to his premature death at 27, interweaves six essays, one interview and 162 images (80 in color) to provide a narrative (and argument) for Basquiat's placement in the art world pantheon. While some critics, like Italian art historian Achille Bonito Oliva, tend to overintellectualize Basquiat's intentions, the artist's interview with Henry Geldzahler reveals his unpretentious methods and practical concerns. Particularly interesting is former Whitney curator Richard D. Marshall's essay, which traces the young artist's many inspirations and influences: Pollock, Twombly, Warhol and, above all, the New York City streets. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Broken Movement</i>, John Krakauer and S. Thomas Carmichael, both experts in the field, provide an account of the neurobiology of motor recovery in the arm and hand after stroke. They cover topics that range from behavior to physiology to cellular and molecular biology. <i>Broken Movement</i> is the only accessible single-volume work that covers motor control and motor learning as they apply to stroke recovery and combines them with motor cortical physiology and molecular biology. The authors cast a critical eye at current frameworks and practices, offer new recommendations for promoting recovery, and propose new research directions for the study of brain repair.</p><p>Krakauer and Carmichael discuss such subjects as the behavioral phenotype of hand and arm paresis in human and non-human primates; the physiology and anatomy of the motor system after stroke; mechanisms of spontaneous recovery; the time course of early recovery; the challenges of chronic stroke; and pharmacological and stem cell therapies. They argue for a new approach in which patients are subjected to higher doses and intensities of rehabilitation in a more dynamic and enriching environment early after stroke. Finally they review the potential of four areas to improve motor recovery: video gaming and virtual reality, invasive brain stimulation, re-opening the sensitive period after stroke, and the application of precision medicine.</p></p><p>John W.

Both the expression 'mass production' and the technology was that lay behind it were developments of the 20th C, attributable in large part to the Ford Motor Co. <br><br> Hounshell explores the important role of individuals in the diffusion and development of production technology and the central place of marketing strategy in the success of selected American manufactures. While Ford Motor company was the seebed of the assembly line revolution, General Motors initiated the new era of annual model change. With the new marketing strategy, the technology of 'the changeover' became of paramount importance. Hounshell chronicles how painfully Ford learned this lesson with the change from the Model T to the Model A and then to the V-8 in 1932.</p><p><p>"The history of technology at its very best.

George Orwell--novelist, journalist, sometime socialist--actually traded his press pass for a uniform and fought against Franco&#39;s Fascists in the Spanish Civil War during 1936 and 1937.

Then, after nearly getting killed, he went back to England and wrote a gripping account of his experiences, as well as a complex analysis of the political machinations that led to the defeat of the socialist Republicans and the victory of the Fascists.8 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Palladio and English Palladianism</h2><p>Investigates the ways in which Bernini, Burlington, Inigo Jones, English neoclassicism, and Venetian religious architecture were influenced by the design principles of the Renaissance architect</p><p></p><h2>A Buyer&#39;s Life: A Concise Guide to Retail Planning and Forecasting</h2><p>The area of retail buying relies heavily on mathematical formulas and forecasting.

In this now classic study, Se�n Burke both provides the first detailed explanation of anti-authorialism and shows how, even taken on its own terms, the attempt to abolish the author is philosophically untenable. Rather than developing a traditionally humanist defence, Burke effectively out-theorises theory through rigorous readings which demonstrate that the concept of the author remained profoundly active even and especially as its disappearance was being articulated. The question of the author, he argues, is not a question within theory but the question of theory.Building on a substantially revised second edition, Burke further explores the challenges faced by an authorial theory that is 'still to come'. Prompted by the responses to the passing of Jacques Derrida in 2004, he revisits the enigmatic borderlines between life and work, life and (authorial) death.<br></p><p><p>Se�n Burke worked in the Department of English Studies at the University of Durham for thirteen years. His academic publications include <i>Authorship: From Plato to the Postmodern: A Reader</i> and <i>The Ethics of Writing: Authorship and Legacy in Plato and Nietzsche</i>. His first novel, <i>Deadwater</i> has been published in France as <i>Au bout des docks</i>.

How long will it take for a viral outbreak in a particular city to reach another city five hundred miles away? In addressing such basic questions, ecologists today are as likely to turn to complicated differential equations as to life histories--a dramatic change from thirty years ago. Population ecology is the mathematical backbone of ecology. Here, two leading experts provide the underlying quantitative concepts that all modern-day ecologists need.</p><br><p> John Vandermeer and Deborah Goldberg show that populations are more than simply collections of individuals. Complex variables such as the size distribution of individuals and allotted territory for expanding groups come into play when mathematical models are applied. The authors build these models from the ground up, from first principles, using a much broader range of empirical examples--from plants to animals, from viruses to humans--than do standard texts. And they address several complicating issues such as age-structured populations, spatially distributed populations, and metapopulations.</p><br><p> Beginning with a review of elementary principles, the book goes on to consider theoretical issues involving life histories, complications in the application of the core principles, statistical descriptions of spatial aggregation of individuals and populations as well as population dynamic models incorporating spatial information, and introductions to two-species interactions.</p><br><p> Complemented by superb illustrations that further clarify the links between the mathematical models and biology, <i>Population Ecology</i> is the most straightforward and authoritative overview of the field to date. It will have broad appeal among undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing ecologists.</p></p><p><p>"Population ecology is rapidly maturing as a theoretical science. One sign of this maturity is the ongoing synthesis between sophisticated mathematical theory and innovative experimental approaches. Yet the traditional education in biology does not equip students with the tools they need to fully appreciate these new theoretical developments. Here is where this admirable book by Vandermeer and Goldberg comes in. A particularly enjoyable aspect of <i>Population Ecology: First Principles</i> is the ability of the authors to relate the complex tapestry of ecological theory to a few fundamental quantitative principles."--<b>Peter Turchin, University of Connecticut</b></p><p>"Vandermeer and Goldberg have written an outstanding book that synthesizes and summarizes the fundamental concepts and principles of population ecology. Its highly approachable treatment of models should give students deep and intuitive insights into population ecology. Because the mathematical techniques presented in the book represent the core toolbox of the discipline, this book is essential reading for anyone going into population and community ecology."--<b>David Tilman, University of Minnesota</b></p><p>"This is an excellent book that I look forward to using in the classroom. It is one of the most understandable in the field. The authors present, in more tractable fashion than do some similar books, fundamental material that all ecologists need. Anyone in the life sciences should immediately recognize the importance of the material. Scholars in economics and the social sciences should also see that the book is very relevant to their disciplines."--<b>David J. Moriarty, California State Polytechnic University</b></p><p>"One of this book's greatest strengths is the way it emphasizes the processes underlying standard ecological models. Rather than relying on plausibility arguments, the authors start from simple mechanistic models--for instance, deriving the Lotka-Volterra competition equations from a model of resource competition. They also present a nice range of practical examples."--<b>Ben Bolker, University of Florida</b></p><b>John H.

In doing this, he has employed primary sources never before translated from the German and Russian. He points out the real reasons for Napoleon's defeat which had nothing to do with cold weather but rather were a complex combination of faulty logistics, bureaucratic mismanagement and Napoleon's own but uncharacteristic indecision and bad choices.</p><p>This major study of one of history's most decisive military campaigns richly details the invasion of Russia in June 1812 by Napoleon's army of 600,000. Although the emperor expected to blitz the Tsar's forces into rapid surrender, five months later he was fortunate to escape with a tattered remnant of 8000 followed by some 40,000 starving stragglers. Riehn, a translator and freelance writer on military topics, analyzes Napoleon's miscalculation of Russian resources and resolve, his poorly conceived logistics and uncharacteristic indecisiveness at Smolensk and Borodino where he missed his two chances to destroy the enemy. Included is a review of French and Russian military establishments of the day, showing how the two forces were mobilized, trained and deployed in the field. Riehn reveals how severe winter conditions during the last part of the retreat enabled Napoleon to claim that "only God and the elements" had proved stronger than his Grand Army. Napoleon actually came away from the 1812 catastrophe with his reputation enhanced. Recommended for military student and general reader alike. Military Book Club selection. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Most historians writing about Napoleon's 1812 debacle succumb to the inherent drama of the tragedy: Moscow in flames, dashing Cossacks, and lines of infantry suffering in the frigid Russian winter. Riehn takes a more hard-eyed professional approach, weighing the technical, strategic, and diplomatic factors in this serious study of the military elements of the campaign. His examination of the historiography, line tactics, and late-Napoleonic battlefield dynamics alone will make this a treatise of lasting importance. Casual readers will still do best with Curtis Cate's popular but respectable The War of the Two Emperors: The Confrontation Between Napoleon and Alexander (LJ 10/1/85).

Political philosophers have focused largely on how to prevent leaders from abusing their power, yet little attention has been paid to what it actually feels like to hold power, how leaders go about their work, and how they relate to the people they lead. In <i>Thinking about Leadership</i>, Nannerl Keohane draws on her experience as the first woman president of Duke University and former president of Wellesley College, as well as her expertise as a leading political theorist, to deepen our understanding of what leaders do, how and why they do it, and the pitfalls and challenges they face.</p><br><p> Keohane engages readers in a series of questions that shed light on every facet of leadership. She considers the traits that make a good leader, including sound judgment, decisiveness, integrity, social skill, and intelligence; the role that gender plays in one's ability to attain and wield power; ethics and morality; the complex relationship between leaders and their followers; and the unique challenges of democratic leadership. Rich with lessons and insights from leaders and political thinkers down through the ages, including Aristotle, Queen Elizabeth I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela, <i>Thinking about Leadership</i> is a must-read for current and future leaders, and for anyone concerned about our prospects for good governance.</p></p><p><p>"Nan Keohane breaks down leadership to the fundamentals--a combination of innate ability and acquired skills that helps motivate others to work toward a common goal. This book is about inspired leadership--and inspiring 'followership'--and should be required reading from the classroom to the boardroom."<b>--John Mack, chairman of the board, Morgan Stanley</b></p><p>"Nan Keohane's book is well-titled. Its focus is on thinking about leadership--exploring its many facets, complexities, and conundrums. It is not a 'how-to-do-it' book, but rather a sophisticated amalgam of the reflections of an author who is both a political philosopher and an experienced leader. Readers will enjoy--as well as learn from--the many references to the experiences of well-known leaders such as Mandela and Lincoln as well as to the voluminous literature on leadership."<b>--William G. Bowen, president emeritus of Princeton University and the Andrew W.

This book is the first to discuss this common disorder from the point of view of Chinese medicine. In addition to the Chinese medical viewpoint on fibromyalgia, this book gives a host of safe, simple, low-or-no-cost home therapies to help prevent or heal this all-too-common problem.</p><p>This book is the 11th in our popular "Curing Naturally with Chinese Medicine" series. We chose to create a book on this subject because there are so many people who suffer from this painful condition and Western medicine has few options for its treatment. <p>Chinese medicine has many helpful treatments which can be received from professional practitioners. But more importantly, there are many easy, inexpensive home remedies and self-care options from Chinese medicine that sufferers can do for themselves. These home remedy options are the heart of this book, for they give the patient the power to make a significant improvement in their own health without great expense and within a short period of time. If you or anyone you know suffers from this debilitating ailment, this book is for you.</p>Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic debilitating condition comprised of generalized body pain and stiffness, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and digestive complaints. Although this is a relatively recent Western medical disease diagnosis, Chinese medical practitioners have been treating body pain, fatigue, insomnia, depression, and digestive complaints for more than 2,000 years. In this book you will learn the Chinese medical theory of the cause of this condition. More than that, you will also learn a host of safe, simple, low or no cost home home therapies to prevent and heal this all too common problem, including: Chinese dietary therapy, Exercise, Deep Relaxation, Chinese herbs and teas, Magnet therapy, Aroma therapy, Chinese foot reflexology, and how to find a professional practitioner of Chinese medicine.</p><h2>The Enjoyment of Music: An Introduction to Perceptive Listening (Eleventh Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>Easy to read, easy to teach, <em>The Enjoyment of Music</em> has been the most trusted introduction to music for over five decades.</strong></p> The Eleventh Edition reflects how today's students learn, listen to, and live with music.

This new book, written by two of the <em>Blueprint for a Green Economy</em> authors, revisits and updates its main messages by asking, first, what has been achieved in the past&nbsp;twenty years, and second, what more needs to be done to generate a truly 'green economy' in the twenty-first century? </p> <p><em>Blueprint for a Green Economy</em>&nbsp;had one over-arching theme. Making economies more sustainable requires urgent progress in three key policy areas: valuing the environment, accounting for the environment and incentives for environmental improvement. Today, with the threat of global warming, the decline in major ecosystems and their services, and fears over energy security, achieving these goals is even more vital. </p> <p>The current book first summarizes the main messages from <em>Blueprint for a Green Economy</em> and explains why, given rapid and widespread global environmental degradation, they are still relevant. The book then examines the progress since <em>Blueprint for a Green Economy</em>&nbsp;in implementing policies and other measures to improve environmental valuation, accounting and incentives. Although much has been accomplished, additional advances are still required to green economies successfully. The book highlights the new policies and approaches needed for economic management of today's environmental concerns. Over&nbsp;twenty years later, <em>A New Blueprint for a Green Economy</em> once again emphasizes practical policies for greening modern economies, and explains why such an economic roadmap to a greener future is essential, if modern economies are to develop successfully and sustainably.</p></p><p><p><strong>Edward B.

Why did he leave the West and move to the Soviet Union despite Stalin&#x2019;s crimes? Why did his astonishing creativity in the 1930s soon dissolve into a far less inspiring output in his later years? The answers can finally be revealed, thanks to Simon Morrison&#x2019;s unique and unfettered access to the family&#x2019;s voluminous papers and his ability to reconstruct the tragic, riveting life of the composer&#x2019;s wife, Lina.<br><br>Morrison&#x2019;s portrait of the marriage of Lina and Serge Prokofiev is the story of a remarkable woman who fought for survival in the face of unbearable betrayal and despair and of the irresistibly talented but heartlessly self-absorbed musician she married. Born to a Spanish father and Russian mother in Madrid at the end of the nineteenth century and raised in Brooklyn, Lina fell in love with a rising-star composer&#x2014;and defied convention to be with him, courting public censure. She devoted her life to Serge and to art, training to be an operatic soprano and following her brilliant husband to Stalin&#x2019;s Russia. Just as Serge found initial acclaim&#x2014;before becoming constricted by the harsh doctrine of socialist-realist music&#x2014;Lina was at first accepted and later scorned, ending her singing career. Serge abandoned her and took up with another woman. Finally, Lina was arrested and shipped off to the gulag in 1948. She would be held in captivity for eight awful years. Meanwhile, Serge found himself the tool of an evil regime to which he was forced to accommodate himself.<br><br>The contrast between Lina and Serge is one of strength and perseverance versus utter self-absorption, a remarkable human drama that draws on the forces of art, sacrifice, and the struggle against oppression. Readers will never forget the tragic drama of Lina&#x2019;s life, and never listen to Serge&#x2019;s music in quite the same way again.<br><b>www.hmhbooks.com/linaandserge</b></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Simon Morrison</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What special research did you do for <em>Lina and Serge</em>?</strong></p> <p>A. I worked for four years in archives in New York, London, Paris, and especially Moscow. The first part of the book, which concerns Lina Prokofiev's childhood and teenage years in New York City, makes extensive use of materials preserved in Brooklyn, along with newspaper databases, ships manifests, and some of her own scattered recollections. I walked the neighborhoods where Lina lived in search of traces of her existence in and around her Brooklyn high school, No. 3, the oldest one continuously operating in the United States. In London, I consulted the recorded interviews and Lina's scattered attempts at an autobiography, which never got beyond her impressions of her distant relatives. The Prokofiev family gave me carte blanche to consult the letters, documents, and photographs in Paris (the homes of Svyatoslav and Serge Prokofiev Jr.). In Moscow I worked for a year in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, also the Russian State Archive of Social-Political History.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did you gain such intimate access to the letters and diaries?</strong></p> <p>A. In April 1955, two years after Serge Prokofiev's premature death from a stroke, his two sons and second wife Mira Mendelson arranged through diplomatic channels for a suitcase of documents to be transferred from New York City to Moscow. Prokofiev had left it there for safekeeping, on deposit at a bank, during his final tour abroad in 1938. Presumably he feared his personal papers falling into the hands of Soviet agents. A year later, the suitcase arrived in Moscow. Its contents were sealed in the vaults of the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, but uncataloged--accessible only to the composer's heirs. Much time passed. Lina Prokofiev was released from the gulag after eight years of imprisonment in 1956. Mira died in 1968; Prokofiev's younger son Oleg defected to the West in 1972; and his older son Svyatoslav accepted French citizenship in 2000, a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But still the archive remained sealed, <em>nikomu ne v�davat'</em>--not to be given out to anyone. I received exclusive access from Svyatoslav in 2008 after several years of work on behalf of the Prokofiev Estate, including a reconstruction of one of Prokofiev's ballets and the realization of the original happy ending version of the ballet <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. It was something of Svyatoslav's dying wish that the true story of his mother be told in unvarnished guise, and so he entrusted me with her intimate letters. These tell the story of her turbulent early years with Serge and their fateful relocation to the Soviet Union in 1936. Sadly, Svyatoslav died before the book was finished. His son, Serge Prokofiev Jr., ensured that I retained my special access to the Moscow archive throughout the writing process, and allowed me to consult those materials about Lina's arrest and imprisonment that he discovered in his father's apartment.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did what you learn affect your thoughts about composer Sergei Prokofiev? </strong></p> <p>A. I learned that all of his love went into his music, and that his wife and children suffered terribly as a result of his self-absorption and belief that his talents were divine, God-given. His conviction that he operated above and apart from the concerns of the real world had terrible real-world consequences. I still hugely respect his genius, but what he allowed to happen to Lina was unconscionable. I can't get my head around it. I would insist that the book tells the story of sacrifice for art, except for the fact that Prokofiev's betrayal of his wife had a deleterious effect on his music. He was never quite the same composer again after he left her.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you think Lina's legacy is?</strong></p> <p>A. Lina defined the 20th century in its most glorious and horrible aspects. Her modest successes on the operatic stage were no match for her astonishing performances in real life: long-suffering would-be bride, glamorous ing�nue, and finally, tragic heroine of the Stalinist police state. She loved her husband despite his shocking betrayal of her in the worst of all places at the worst of all times: Stalinist Russia during the Purges. And that love manifested itself in her efforts to preserve his musical legacy after her release from the gulag. She did not think of herself as Prokofiev's muse, but she truly was. She inspired the opera <em>The Fiery Angel</em> and the ballet <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. And then, at the end of her life, long after his death, she brought unknown Prokofiev scores to the world's attention.</p> &nbsp; <p><b>Photographs of Lina and Serge</b></p> <p>Click on the images below to see the full-sized images.</p> Serge Prokofiev at the Hotel Wellington, New York City, October or November 1918, before his American debut at Aeolian Hall.

Located near the remote center of the Indian Ocean and accessible only by military transport, the base was a little-known launch pad for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and may house a top-secret CIA prison where terror suspects are interrogated and tortured. But Diego Garcia harbors another dirty secret, one that has been kept from most of the world--until now. Island of Shame is the first major book to reveal the shocking truth of how the United States conspired with Britain to forcibly expel Diego Garcia&#39;s indigenous people--the Chagossians--and deport them to slums in Mauritius and the Seychelles, where most live in dire poverty to this day.

Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

Some believed that the detectives were protecting society from dangerous criminal conspiracies; others thought that armed Pinkertons were capital&#x2019;s tool to crush worker dissent. Yet the image of the Pinkerton detective also inspired romantic and sensationalist novels, reflected shifting ideals of Victorian manhood, and embodied a particular kind of rough frontier justice. </p><p><i>Inventing the Pinkertons </i>examines the evolution of the agency as a pivotal institution in the cultural history of American monopoly capitalism. Historian S. Paul O&#x2019;Hara intertwines political, social, and cultural history to reveal how Scottish-born founder Allan Pinkerton insinuated his way to power and influence as a purveyor of valuable (and often wildly wrong) intelligence in the Union cause. During Reconstruction, Pinkerton turned his agents into icons of law and order in the Wild West. Finally, he transformed his firm into a for-rent private army in the war of industry against labor. Having begun life as peddlers of information and guardians of mail bags, the Pinkertons became armed mercenaries, protecting scabs and corporate property from angry strikers.</p><p>O&#x2019;Hara argues that American capitalists used the Pinkertons to enforce new structures of economic and political order. Yet the infamy of the Pinkerton agent also gave critics and working communities a villain against which to frame their resistance to the new industrial order. Ultimately, <i>Inventing the Pinkertons</i> is a gripping look at how the histories of American capitalism, industrial folklore, and the nation-state converged.</p></p><p><p>The fascinating story of the most notorious detective agency in US history.</p><p><b>S.

The memoir, however, is only secondarily about combat. Mostly it tells what it was like to be "young and happy and silly" while training for, then participating in, the Second World War. The author recalls that he had three major goals in those days: getting drunk, getting laid and getting into the war. Hynes includes classic military-on-the-make anecdotes, and, although he and many of his fellow pilots considered "gross and ugly" the behavior of the more sexually aggressive members of the squadron, their gross and ugly antics are tenderly, and hilariously, depicted. The author married during the war, and his description of the relationship (he and his wife were part of a "game" that, in retrospect, he calls "Grown-ups") is as moving as his account of the first combat death he witnessed. 35,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Teenager Hynes (now Woodrow Wilson Professor of Literature, Princeton) took naval flight training, became a Marine bomber pilot, and late in World War II flew over 100 missions against the Japanese. His scintillating descriptions of this time, of his friends and often bawdy fellow pilots, of his tentative romantic adventures, and of new vistas and challenges, are woven together with skill and intelligence. This is not a standard story of courage in war, but rather a tale of the dogged and mortal persistence to pass many versions of "the Test" that training and combat and even sex presented to a young man preparing for war. An introspective, winning, and vivid recollection sketched by a gifted observer. Mel D.

This thoroughly revised and expanded second edition sets the pace and combines information on leadership, strategic planning, and tools that can help leaders and followers enhance organizational achievement.Bryson shows how leaders and managers of public and nonprofit organizations can use strategic planning to strengthen their organizations. In this expanded edition, the author includes many new examples of successful and unsuccessful strategic planning practices. In addition, this volume offers entirely new chapters that address the implementation of strategic planning, reassess strategies and the strategic planning process, and outline the key leadership roles that must be undertaken if strategic planning is to be effective. This book outlines the reasons public and nonprofit organizations should embrace strategic planning as a way of improving their performance and presents an effective planning process--Strategy Change Cycle--that has been successfully implemented by a large number of public and nonprofit organizations. Bryson offers detailed guidance on applying the process, describing specific tools and techniques that will prove invaluable.The author discusses the major roles that must be played by individuals and groups for strategic planning to be successful and gives specific guidance on how this can be accomplished. And he clarifies the method by which strategic planning can be institutionalized so that strategic thought and action will be encouraged and embraced within the entire organization.Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations will be an invaluable resource for leaders, managers, policymakers, and planners in public agencies (such as state and local governments) and in nonprofit organizations (including hospitals a<b>John M.

Not only did Madison establish the fundamental American concept of pluralism, his appreciation of the logic of institutional design as a key to successful democratic reform still influences modern theory and research.<br>This book evaluates the legacy of James Madison as the product of a scholarly politician&#x2015;a politician who thought carefully about institutions in the context of action. It brings together thoughtful responses to Madison and his theory from a broad cross-section of modern political science, and views Madison not as an icon or mouthpiece of an era, but as a &#x201c;modern&#x201d; political scientist who was able to implement many of his theoretical ideas in a practical forum.</p><p>"Of all the Framers, James Madison arguably was closest to being a political scientist in the contemporary sense of the term. In preparing for the Philadelphia Convention, for instance, he made a thorough comparative study of ancient and modern confederacies. . . . These essays make a valuable and varied contribution to our understanding of Madison's political science and will elicit productive agreements and disagreements."&#x2014;Presidential Studies Quarterly<br>&#x201c;James Madison was America's first political scientist, and is arguably still its greatest. In these essays, Madison's latter-day heirs subject his close reasoning on the major problems of federalism and republicanism to some close scrutiny of their own. The result is a volume that illuminates both the sources of Madison's continuing influence on our ideas of the Founding era and the ways in which contemporary political science differs from his. One comes away from these papers impressed not only by how deeply the contributors have thought about Madison, but also by his capacity to inspire and demand continued critical thinking about the American constitutional system.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jack Rakove, Stanford UniversitySamuel Kernell is Professor of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego.</p><h2>Wieland: Or The Transformation: With Memoirs Of Carwin The Biloquist: A Fragment</h2><p>Narrated by Clara, the only survivor of the cursed Wieland family, this Gothic tale builds in suspense to one tragic night when Clara's brother, in a divinely inspired seizure, commits an unspeakable act. Edited and with an Introduction by Fred Lewis Pattee.<br></p><p>This edition includes a comprehensive biography of Charles Brockden Brown from the 1856 edition of the Cyclopaedia of American Literature, and an introduction from noted scholar James P. Lynch.Theodore Wieland hears mysterious voices. Are these the result of delusions, ventriloquism, or divine forces? In this Gothic thriller, novelist Charles Brockden Brown (1771-1810) portrays a man beset by religious guilt which erupts into mania, transforming him into the murderer of his wife and children. Once the mystery of the controlling voices is revealed, Theodore&#39;s sister, Clara, undergoes her own transformation, as she moves from bitterness and despair over her brother&#39;s destruction to resignation and, finally, peace. Brown&#39;s fascination with the scientifically bizarre and the macabre influenced Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. But he sought the solutions to his mysteries in nature and in the depths of the human mind, rather than in the realm of the supernatural.</p><h2>International Finance For Dummies</h2><p><b>Want to get the most out of your International Finance course?</b> <p>Nowadays the value of daily foreign exchange trading is more than one hundred times the value of annual international trade in goods and services.

Born in Birkhamsted, England, he lived in Paris and Antibes before his death in April 1991.Like the recent Last Stories , this is a collection of previously uncollected material--in this case essays, reviews and travel pieces from the entire length of the author's 60-year writing career (the earliest written while he was still at Oxford). The material varies considerably in interest and quality, though it is surprising to observe that from the start the eye for the telling, often sordid detail was at work, the knack for establishing atmosphere in a deft stroke or two. The travel pieces are superbly crafted essays, combining politics and sociology seamlessly with history and scenery: on Indo-China before the Vietnam War, on old and new Cuba, on Haiti, Paraguay, a haunting evocation of Goa. Greene also wrote passionately and despairingly on the possibilities--and mostly failed promise--of film; a movie critic in the '30s, he was one of the best. A collection like this does not add to his reputation but is interesting, nonetheless, for the consistency of his dour vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Urban Aboriginals: A Celebration of Leathersexuality</h2><p>A subculture of gay men participate in a radical form of sexuality and community known as leather. Through intimate forms of encounter, using such tools as pain-pleasure, bondage, and role-play, leather can bring a shift of conciousness and a new vision of the self. This innovative book pioneered in sensitively exploring and celebrating leathersexuality. As relevant today as when it was written 20 years ago, Urban Aboriginals is an intimate view of the gay male leather community. Within its pages, author Geoff Mains explores the spritual, sexual, emotional, cultural and physiological aspects that make this "scene" one of the most prominent yet misunderstood subcultures in our society.<br><br>Geoff Mains was a sweet, intelligent, articulate, and wonderful man who cared passionately about the leather community. He wanted to make sure that its accomplishments would be remembered and its wild beauty understood. Urban Aboriginals resulted from his love and is an enduring part of his legacy. It is a unique cultural study, and a priceless document of a now vanished time.</p><p>Urban Aboriginals was an instant classic the moment it appeared in the spirng of 1984. Published by the always daring Gay Sunshine Press, its author was a little known Canadian writer, Geoff Mains, who wove an audacious mix of theory and lived experience to explain the gay male leather scene. Mains introduced the notion of endorphins, recently discovered opium-like chemicals in the central nervous system, as a critical component of S/M sexuality. He furthered his insight by linking the social behaviors of this little understood subculture to the tribal rites of indigenous societies around the world. parts biochemistry lesson, anthropological study, and candid journalism, the book opened a gateway of revelation that is still being felt to this day.... <p>Mains settled in San Francisco upon completing his book. He spent the last few years of his life among a community he had boundless regard for, providing witness in a novel, Gentle Warriors. Soon after that work was done, Mains died of complications due to AIDS on June 21, 1989. Well over a decade later, Mains' writing continues to be cited by influencial sources, including The New York TImes, which quoted from his diary these poignant words about the plague's impact on the world he loved: "I stand, uncertain....The pst that I beleived in, the times I lived for, are gone." </p><p>Urban Aboriginals lived on, however, through a second edition and a whole new generation of appreciative readers. Main's message, enhanced by photographer Robert Pruzan's powerful images, continued to enlighten and affirm an ever-loving tribe of "modern primitives." Now some years out of print, the book is being circulated again. </p><p>With original plates and negatives long gone, piecing the book back to its original form has entailed an act of literary archeology. Appropriately enough, ;proceeds from this new edition will help preserve thelife work of Mains and Pruzan (who also died of AIDS), now permanently archived at the San Francisco Bay Area Gay &amp; Lesbian Historical Society. A sincere word of thanks is also due to the book's original publisher, Winston Leyland, who graciously consented to its revival. </p><p>Many urban aboriginals everywhere continue to value and learn from these brave and visionary pages. -Mark Thompson</p>This is a journey into the aboriginal soul. It is not a voyage into forests that reverberate with drums, but into an abyss upon which, precariously, western civilization balances. It is a journey marked by fetish and mana, shaman, ritual and trance. Here, men partake of a very real magic. They are men among whom danger, fear and new hope have broken many of the misconceptions upon which western civilization falters. These are men not apart from but of the very blood of that civilization. Urbane and savage in the smae breath, they are animal and human in the same stroke.

The Papal Conclave is an event like no other. Highly secret and conducted behind the locked doors of the Sistine Chapel, it happens about eight times every century. It is an event that has evolved over the centuries and is always filled with high drama: cardinals meeting <i>en masse </i>in their scarlet robes, throngs of the faithful standing watch in St. Peter's Square, the black or white smoke billowing from the chimney signalling the election of a new Pontiff Since secrecy was not heavily invoked until the twentieth century, there is a vast store of rich material to work from and Fred Baumgartner uses it to its utmost detailing the bickering and blatant politicking that goes on behind the locked doors of the Sistine Chapel in this important and timely book.<br></p><p><br><b>Frederic J.

We think of him as a larger-than-life original, yet in <i>The Naturalist</i>, Darrin Lunde has firmly situated Roosevelt&#x2019;s indomitable curiosity about the natural world in the tradition of museum naturalism.&nbsp; <br><br>As a child, Roosevelt actively modeled himself on the men (including John James Audubon and Spencer F. Baird) who pioneered this key branch of biology by developing a taxonomy of the natural world&#x2014;basing their work on the experiential study of nature. The impact that these scientists and their trailblazing methods had on Roosevelt shaped not only his audacious personality but his entire career, informing his work as a statesman and ultimately affecting generations of Americans&#x2019; relationship to this country&#x2019;s wilderness. <br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on Roosevelt&#x2019;s diaries and travel journals as well as Lunde&#x2019;s own role as a leading figure in museum naturalism today, <i>The Naturalist</i> reads Roosevelt through the lens of his love for nature. From his teenage collections of birds and small mammals to his time at Harvard and political rise, Roosevelt&#x2019;s fascination with wildlife and exploration culminated in his triumphant expedition to Africa, a trip which he himself considered to be the apex of his varied life. <br><br>With narrative verve, Lunde brings his singular experience to bear on our twenty-sixth president&#x2019;s life and constructs a perceptively researched and insightful history that tracks Roosevelt&#x2019;s maturation from exuberant boyhood hunter to vital champion of serious scientific inquiry.</p></p><p><p><b>DARRIN LUNDE </b>is a Supervisory Museum Specialist in the Division of Mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Still sporting a full head of baby curls, the child seemed barely old enough to be out in the city alone, and he looked frail, as if he might have been sick.<br><br>Horse-drawn carriages rattled by, dropping off elegant women in hoop-skirted dresses and big hats. Gathering their billowing raiments up with their fingers, they floated in and out of stores showcasing velvet gloves, mink stoles, and fancy sweets. This was &#x201c;Ladies&#x2019; Mile&#x201d;&#x2014;that stretch of Broadway between Union and Madison Squares where New York&#x2019;s fancy boutiques competed for space and well-heeled customers.<br><br>Jostled by the swarms of fashionable shoppers, the boy continued along Broadway, glancing through the storefront windows, until he passed a familiar grocery, where something caught his eye. Amid the usual cartons of fruits and vegetables was an object strangely out of place, splayed out on a slab of wood. It was the dull mass of a seal, dead less than a day. Placed on display to attract paying customers, its corpulent body drew the child&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>Sliding his hand along the seal&#x2019;s glossy-smooth pelt and peering deeply into its clouding eyes, he was overwhelmed with interest. Its eyes were so big, and they were fringed with delicate eyelashes&nbsp;like his own. Curious onlookers stood back, only a brave few leaning in for a closer look, but the little boy remained transfixed. It was probably a harbor seal, still fairly common in New York Harbor. So transfixed was the boy by this exotic creature that he raced home for a notebook and ruler, returning moments later to measure the carcass and jot down a few notes on its color and appearance. The eight-year-old boy then wrote a detailed natural history of seals based entirely on that one dead animal.<br><br>Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s life changed forever in that encounter, for it marked, as he later noted, &#x201c;the first day&#x201d; of his career as a naturalist. Recalling the event in his autobiography decades later, Roosevelt wrote that the seal filled him with &#x201c;every possible feeling of romance and adventure.&#x201d; It was so unlike anything he had ever seen before. Touching that seal, he would have felt the stiffness of its long, graceful whiskers, and, gently lifting up its lips, he would have seen the gleaming white teeth. The ears were just tiny holes, barely noticeable in its dense fur. Squeezing the front flippers, he would have felt that they were just like greatly enlarged hands, the individual finger bones completely encased in the flesh of the flipper with tiny claws extending from the tip. Feeling the seal&#x2019;s body with his own hands, he could appreciate all the similarities to his own basic anatomy, but he wanted to get closer&#x2014;to take the animal home, perhaps to dissect or stuff it. He had read about how naturalists kept animal specimens to study them, and now he had a chance to practice naturalism himself.<br><br>Born on October 27, 1858, to Theodore Roosevelt Sr. and Martha Bulloch Roosevelt (known as &#x201c;Mittie&#x201d;), Theodore was one in a long line of Roosevelts to have lived in Manhattan, the descendant of some of New York&#x2019;s early Dutch settlers. The family had always been well-off, but Theodore&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, Cornelius Roosevelt, amassed an incredible fortune through real estate speculation. From his redbrick mansion on the southwest corner of Broadway at 14th Street, Cornelius settled each of his five sons in nearby homes. Theodore Sr. was given a four-story brownstone just a short walk uptown,&nbsp;on East 20th Street. It was here that Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born and raised with his older sister, Anna (nicknamed &#x201c;Bamie&#x201d;), younger brother, Elliott (&#x201c;Ellie&#x201d;), and their baby sister, Corinne (&#x201c;Conie&#x201d;).<br><br>Tall, bearded, and with fierce blue eyes beneath heavy brows, Theodore Roosevelt Sr. looked grim, but to those who knew him well, Mr. Roosevelt was benevolence personified. Although he was a partner in the Wall Street investment banking firm Roosevelt &amp; Son, he preferred to think of himself as a philanthropist, and he took great pleasure in championing charitable causes. He especially adored children, even spending Sunday evenings serving meals to destitute newsboys and street urchins.<br><br>To his own family Roosevelt Sr. represented strength and courage, tenderness and great unselfishness. He was so admired by his children that they went to great lengths to compete for his attention. Theodore Jr. later recalled that his father was &#x201c;the best man I ever knew&#x201d; but added that he was also &#x201c;the only man of whom I was ever really afraid.&#x201d; What Theodore feared most was his father&#x2019;s stern disapproval&#x2014;for Theodore, nothing was more important than earning the respect of his father.<br><br>Perhaps more than anything, Mr. Roosevelt was shaped by his views as a &#x201c;muscular Christian.&#x201d; A popular movement with British and American Protestants of the Victorian era, muscular Christianity taught that Jesus was not only morally strong but also physically sturdy. Masculinity&#x2014;as shown in the will to fight for a cause&#x2014;was seen as integral to Christian morality. Muscular Christianity was the answer to a growing concern among men that the world was becoming overly feminized, a reaction to the increasing number of sedentary occupations in the industrializing world and women&#x2019;s growing role in the church. The movement stressed physical activity and spending time outdoors, urging cold-water swims and vigorous mountain climbs.<br><br>In sharp contrast to the muscular Christians and her robust, rugged husband, Martha Roosevelt was meek and genteel, a southerner who had grown up in a Georgia plantation house. While Mr. Roosevelt worked tirelessly, Mrs. Roosevelt was physically frail and often&nbsp;complained of fatigue. She was obsessively hygienic and had a penchant for immaculate white dresses, which she wore year-round. One acquaintance described her as &#x201c;the purest woman he ever saw. No matter how dirty, hot, and ruffled everyone else looked, Mrs. Roosevelt seemed so cool and clean. No dirt ever stopped near her.&#x201d; To her children, she was distant, like a delicate china doll&#x2014;beautiful to look at but fragile and cold.<br><br>Young Theodore Jr. inherited his mother&#x2019;s frailty. No amount of money could spare him the almost constant stomachaches, headaches, coughs, fevers, and nausea he suffered. But Theodore&#x2019;s most chronic and persistent struggle was with asthma. He was plagued by the horror of battling for a shallow gasp of air, only to have anxiety trigger still more severe struggles for breath. Theodore&#x2019;s asthma attacks lasted from a few hours to several days of nonstop wheezing, and it was never entirely certain that he would survive to adulthood.<br><br>At the time, asthma was a poorly understood condition, which doctors mistakenly attributed to a narrow chest. There were no effective treatments, so the sufferers and their families were often left to devise their own desperate cures. Roosevelt Sr.&#x2014;so distraught by his son&#x2019;s ill-health&#x2014;once summoned a horse and rig from a neighboring stable so that he could take young Theodore on a vigorous nighttime ride, attempting to force air into the small boy&#x2019;s lungs.<br><br>Fearful of letting the sickly boy out of their sight, his family rarely allowed him far from their watchful eyes, and (except for a very brief period) he never attended school. Although trapped inside all day, fearing his next asthma attack, Theodore sought solace in his father&#x2019;s library&#x2014;a dark, windowless room on the first floor of their town house. Lined with bookcases of &#x201c;gloomy respectability&#x201d; and cluttered with coarse horsehair chairs that scratched his bare legs, the library was, nonetheless, a sanctuary for the young boy. Sitting on his favorite velvet stool or standing with one leg propped against a wall and his neck bent sharply downward, he lost himself in books.<br><br>In these tomes, Theodore found adventure. One of his favorites was Scots medical missionary David Livingstone&#x2019;s Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa. Although it was too large and heavy for a small boy such as Teddy to carry properly, he dragged the book around the house, begging people to read it to him. Livingstone had left his native Scotland to devote his life to evangelism in South Africa, but he was much better known for his explorations of the African continent than for his religious work. Missionary Travels documented those exploits and was illustrated with detailed engravings. Roosevelt may have been too young to understand the words, but the pictures in Livingstone&#x2019;s book spoke clearly: a desperate man pinned to the earth by a snarling lion; men with spears and shields driving whole herds of zebras, elands, and antelope into giant pitfall traps dug into the earth; a dugout canoe being violently tipped by an enraged hippopotamus, the passengers flailing their arms and leaping to escape.<br><br>The man squirming under the lion&#x2019;s paw was David Livingstone himself. He had been trying to help some villagers by shooting one of the lions raiding their cattle corrals. Firing both barrels of his muzzle-loading rifle, he only wounded the lion, which charged him as he hastily reloaded. The animal sprang onto Livingstone, bit into his shoulder, and pulled him down to the ground. &#x201c;Growling horribly, he shook me as a terrier dog does a rat,&#x201d; Livingstone explained. &#x201c;It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was no sense of pain nor feeling of terror, though I was quite conscious of all that was happening.&#x201d;<br><br>Even more influential to young Teddy than Livingstone&#x2019;s writings were the books of novelist and adventurer Captain Thomas Mayne Reid, whose yarns of hunting, animal lore, and natural history were enormously popular during Roosevelt&#x2019;s youth. Described as adventure novels but also as juvenile scientific travelogues, Reid&#x2019;s writing displayed no stylistic pretensions, and he made it very clear that his books were written for boys. His accurate descriptions of the natural world&#x2014;everything from mammals and birds to plants&#x2014;became the mise-en-sc�ne of all Reid&#x2019;s books.<br><br>Reid championed the genre of the hunter-naturalists&#x2014;those intrepid men of the nineteenth century who were at once avid huntsmen and students of nature, and he counted himself among their ranks. &#x201c;I have ridden wildly with the hunter and strolled quietly with the&nbsp;naturalist,&#x201d; Reid explained. &#x201c;I excel not in the chase, I excel not in a knowledge of natural history&#x2014;but both I love.&#x201d; To Reid, the adventure of the hunt and the quiet study of nature were intimately connected.<br><br>One of Reid&#x2019;s books in particular must have been especially inspiring to young Roosevelt, presaging much of his naturalist career. The Boy Hunters details the lives of three brothers who are sent off by their father on an expedition to shoot a white buffalo for a great museum in Europe. Most important, Reid took the boys and their mission seriously, making very clear from the outset that they were capable of this feat. It&#x2019;s likely that Roosevelt&#x2019;s first impressions of naturalism were formed by countless hours spent with The Boy Hunters. Here were children free to roam outdoors in the fresh air all day. They traipsed through the woods with guns and knives; they were crack shots and fearlessly killed charging bears and menacing alligators. They collected gunnysacks full of specimens, preserving them in little natural-history museums of their own making.<br><br>Equally significantly for Roosevelt, Reid wrote about the father of these young hunters. Unable to join the hunt because of an old soldiering injury&#x2014;one that left him with a wooden leg&#x2014;the father sent his boys off on their buffalo-hunting expedition with a great sense of pride, boasting to his neighbors about his strong &#x201c;boy men.&#x201d;<br><br>How Theodore must have wanted to have such adventures; how he must have wanted his father to be proud of his bold and enterprising character. Trapped indoors on East 20th Street, Theodore could only read with rapture the novels of Thomas Mayne Reid and others, the sole antidote to his sickly life indoors. Adventure stories gave him an escape into a world full of exciting possibilities, but the excitement was always out of reach&#x2014;until he stumbled upon that dead seal on Broadway.<br><br>Years later, Roosevelt admitted in his autobiography that the moment he discovered the creature, all the stories he had read sprang to life before him. Adventure suddenly seemed attainable, and, for the first time, Roosevelt thought maybe he could pursue the life of a hunter-naturalist, just like a character in a Thomas Mayne Reid book.<br><br>Inspired, Roosevelt returned daily to that storefront to check on&nbsp;the dead seal. He tried to persuade the shopkeeper to give him the whole animal, but since the carcass was already starting to decay, young Theodore had to settle for just the head, which, perhaps together with a few equally pleased flies, he proudly carried home.<br><br>Roosevelt wanted to clean the seal head to save its skull, and from his readings he would have been familiar with at least some of the methods used for cleaning skulls. One technique is bacterial maceration, which requires placing the bone in a vat of warm water for days and weeks at a time. Bacteria gradually build up, rotting the meat off and turning the water into a brown mushy soup. This method literally stinks, and it is a slow, disgusting process. If Roosevelt prepared his seal skull using this technique, his parents would have shown unbelievable tolerance, especially in light of his mother&#x2019;s aversion to filth.<br><br>Another method involves placing the skull in a chamber of flesh-eating insects. Any invertebrate inclined to eat flesh will do, including ants, woodlice, or even maggots&#x2014;but flesh-eating beetles of the dermestid family are the most efficient. &#x201c;Bugging&#x201d; a skull yields superior results, because all those little mouthparts quickly pull flesh off without harming bone.<br><br>But Roosevelt most likely prepared his treasure by boiling it until the meat cooked off. Boiling is the fastest and most intuitive of all bone-cleaning methods, and there is an early reference to Roosevelt once asking a cook to boil a woodchuck carcass for him. The animal can&#x2019;t just be plopped into a pot and boiled intact; first the carcass has to be gutted and skinned, and the major muscle masses have to be carefully removed. Even after boiling, a certain amount of scraping is required to remove the last stubborn bits of gristle adhering tenaciously to bone, and the boiled brain still has to be sloshed out the back of the skull&#x2014;not an easy job for the squeamish.<br><br>Holding the finished skull in his hands, he would have seen for the first time how the seal&#x2019;s teeth worked&#x2014;lower molars interlocking neatly with the uppers. The suture lines&#x2014;the places where the different bones of the skull fuse together&#x2014;would have been obvious, and Roosevelt might have easily learned all the bones&#x2019; names: frontals, parietals, nasals, occipitals. He could estimate the size of the eyes by placing a ruler across their bony orbits. In the back of each eye socket&nbsp;he would have seen the tiny hole for the optic nerve to pass through to the brain. Inside the nose he would have seen the delicate, scroll-like bone that supports the membranes responsibl...</p><h2>Organizational Learning and the Learning Organization: Developments in Theory and Practice</h2><p>`A valuable resource for academics and practitioners in management and corporate strategy, as well as those involved in mangement training and development&#x2032; - <b><i>European Foundation for Management Development<p></p> <p></p> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i>&#x2032;The editors&#x2032; overall assessment is that there has been insufficient dialogue between the two camps of action research and theorizing....

Correspondence is the defining character of all of Johnson&#x2019;s work, particularly his mail art. Intended to be read, to be received, to be corresponded with, his letters (usually both image and textual in character) were folded and delivered to an individual reader, to be opened and read, again and again. Johnson's correspondence includes letter to friends William S. Wilson, Dick Higgins, Richard Lippold, Toby Spiselman, Joseph Cornell, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, Robert Motherwell, Eleanor Antin, Germaine Green, Lynda Benglis, Arakawa and Madeline Gins, Christo, Billy Name, Jim Rosenquist and Albert M. Fine, among many others. The subjects of his correspondence ranged from the New York avant-garde (Cage, Johns, de Kooning, Duchamp) to filmmakers such as John Waters, philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and writers such as Gertrude Stein and Marianne Moore. This collection of more than 200 selected letters and writings--most of which are previously unpublished--opens a new view into the sprawling, multiplicitous nature of Johnson&#x2019;s art, revealing not only how he created relationships, glyphs and puzzles in connecting words, phrases, people and ideas, but also something about the elusive Johnson himself. In a 1995 article in <i>The New York Times</i>, Roberta Smith wrote: "Make room for Ray Johnson, whose place in history has been only vaguely defined. Johnson&#x2019;s beguiling, challenging art has an exquisite clarity and emotional intensity that makes it much more than simply a remarkable mirror of its time, although it is that, too."</p><p>The writings also convey the colorful, staccato delivery that characterized Johnson's unique manner of speaking that was so much a part of his elusive persona. (David Ebony <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>Perhaps this book&#x2019;s greatest accomplishment is that it not only clues a reader into the myriad thought processes of an artist like Ray Johnson, but&#x2015;by way of correspondences&#x2015;sheds light upon the mindset and artistic leanings of an entire generation of artists and thinkers. (John Gibbs <i>The Improbable</i>)<br><br>The artist Ray Johnson (1927-1995) is best known for his collages, dense with images pulled from pop culture and personal obsessions. But his most radical work was his New York Correspondence School, devoted to the circulation of mail art - in the form of letters, postcards and drawings - through the postal system. Because much of the work in this epistolary mode isn't visual art in the usual sense, we don't see it much in exhibitions, and Siglio has come to the rescue with an extraordinary volume of Johnson's letter-essay-poem collages. Here he is at his witty, scary artist-poet best, and there is no one like him. (Holland Cotter <i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>Full of seemingly mad illustrations and poetically esoteric lists, the entries in Not Nothing almost explicitly demand artists to pick up where Johnson left off and continue the conversation. (Mark Guiducci <i>Vogue.com</i>)<br><br>The book crackles with intellectual energy, with enough drawings and mini-collages embedded in its reproduced texts to hold even a nonreader's attention. Most importantly, it fills out the picture of what and who Johnson was: a brilliant, uncontainable polymath, an artist-poet, the genuine item. (Holland Cotter <i>The New York Times Arts &amp; Leisure</i>)<br><br>For, while the increased availability of Johnson&#x2019;s letters, notes, and statements subtilizes our understanding of this legendarily well-connected yet enigmatic artist, his flattened logorrheia is also just fun to read. (Francis Richard <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>When Ray Johnson famously committed suicide by swimming out to sea in 1995, he left behind a conflicted legacy. Johnson was a pioneer of Pop, Conceptual and Mail art, yet the artist refuted all of these terms. He was an increasingly reclusive figure who, to paraphrase writer William S. Wilson, &#x201c;made art that was not about social comment but of sociability,&#x201d; exploring new interfaces between his work and its audiences (and collaborators). His methods were temporal as much as they were spatial &#x2015; lacking finality, Johnson&#x2019;s practice embraced contingency and process over a finished product. These strategies resist the exhibition form, and one can see how the intimacy and transportability of the book might offer the perfect platform for his often diaristic work. This year Siglio Press has brought together over 200 selected letters and writings &#x2015; most of them unpublished &#x2015; for Not Nothing: Selected Writings by Ray Johnson, 1954-1994 and re-published The Paper Snake by Ray Johnson, an artist&#x2019;s book from 1965. Designed by Dick Higgins and envisaged as an experimental solution to compiling and exhibiting Johnson&#x2019;s works, The Paper Snake offers a selection of elliptical poetry, drawings, collages and rubbings. With introductory essays, and designed with an attuned sensitivity to the original material, the two new publications will introduce a new generation to the restless work of Ray Johnson. (George Vasey <i>Kaleidescope Magazine</i>)<br><br>Not Nothing is a display of ashes. It is made for looking but, because of its reformulation of the social into a tangible maze, I prefer to torch and snort it. An experimental privacy manifesto invading my nasal passages. The documents it contains corrode things out of things&#x2015;items more perverse than the baloney out of the sandwich, chomping out the meat upon which our artistic economy sustains itself.

The phenomenal success of <i>Real Writing </i>and testimonials from many adopters confirm this core belief. Students are motivated to learn and improve when they connect the ability to write well with their larger goals &#x2014; with what they want to do in life and who they want to become. A range of features in the book shows writing to be an essential and achievable skill. In Profiles of Success, former students, now employed in a variety of professions, describe the academic, financial, and personal challenges they have overcome and the importance of good writing skills to their work. Presenting instruction in manageable increments, <i>Real Writing </i>features the "Four Basics" of each type of writing and begins its full grammar coverage with the "Four Most Serious Errors." With abundant and lively practices, assignments, and activities, <i>Real Writing </i>successfully motivates students to improve their writing as no other text does. In this edition Susan Anker continues to find new ways to help students, encouraging them to connect with their college communities and, as always, to connect their writing with their larger goals.</p><p>Susan Anker (BA, MEd, Boston University) brings a unique perspective to the teaching of the developmental writing course. She taught English and developmental writing before entering college publishing, where she worked for eighteen years: as a sales representative and English/ESL editor at Macmillan Publishing Company; as developmental English/ESL editor, executive editor, and editor in chief at St. Martin s Press; and as vice president and editor in chief for humanities at Houghton Mifflin Company. In each of these positions, she worked with developmental writing instructors and students, maintaining her early interest in the field. Since the publication of the first edition of &#34;Real Writing&#34; in 1998, Anker has traveled extensively to campuses across the country, continuing her conversations with instructors and students and giving workshops and presentations. She believes that the writing course is, for many students, their first, best opportunity to learn the skills they will need to succeed in college and achieve their goals.&#34;</p><h2>Great Gatsby, The</h2><p>A young man, newly rich, tries to recapture the past and win back his former love, despite the fact that she has married</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Roller Coaster: Wooden and Steel Coasters, Twisters and Corkscrews</h2><p>A dramatic history of the great roller coasters of the world traces their evolution from their pioneering designers to the creation of modern high-tech coasters, accompanied by a host of trivia, anecdotes, memorabilia, and dozens of full-color photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Live Form: Women, Ceramics, and Community</h2><p>Ceramics had a far-reaching impact in the second half of the twentieth century, as its artists worked through the same ideas regarding abstraction and form as those for other creative mediums. <i>Live Form</i> shines new light on the relation of ceramics to the artistic avant-garde by looking at the central role of women in the field: potters who popularized ceramics as they worked with or taught male counterparts like John Cage, Peter Voulkos, and Ken Price.<br><br> Sorkin focuses on three Americans who promoted ceramics as an advanced artistic medium: Marguerite Wildenhain, a Bauhaus-trained potter and writer; Mary Caroline (M. C.) Richards, who renounced formalism at Black Mountain College to pursue new performative methods; and Susan Peterson, best known for her live throwing demonstrations on public television. Together, these women pioneered a hands-on teaching style and led educational and therapeutic activities for war veterans, students, the elderly, and many others. Far from being an isolated field, ceramics offered a sense of community and social engagement, which, Sorkin argues, crucially set the stage for later participatory forms of art and feminist collectivism.</p><p><b>Jenni Sorkin</b> is assistant professor in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture at the University of California, Santa Barbara.&#x201c;A superbly researched, beautifully written reflection on three women potters and their influence on the growth of ceramics, and the art world in general, over the past 50 years. . . . Marked by precision and clarity, this is a valuable resource for those interested in the history of craft or the evolution of art education.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone interested in the history of contemporary craft will benefit immensely from reading <i>Live Form</i>.&#x201d; (<i>ARLIS/NA Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Sorkin proposes that the performative nature of throwing, as used by Wildenhain, Richards and Peterson, predicated the &#x2018;artist-performer,&#x2019; and positions live form as an important tool that has implications beyond individual art production, stretching its influence to learning and the community. In doing so, Sorkin elevates ceramics out of the binary dialogue of ceramics-as-pottery and ceramics-as-sculpture. Through shining a light on the careers of these women, she proves that ceramics as a practice has so much more to give than pure object production &#x2013; it also has far reaching implications within the fields of socio-political, community, personal enrichment and participatory practice." (<i>CFile Online</i>)<br><br>"Sorkin provides a new historical grounding for contemporary participatory and socially engaged art by focusing on three major figures in postwar ceramics: Marguerite Wildenhain; Mary Caroline Richards; and Susan Peterson. In this book, Sorkin makes an important methodological, as well as historical, intervention. She asserts that ceramics as a field is less about the objects themselves, and more about the act of making, which connects both to theories of pedagogy and performance." (<i>The Getty blog</i>)<br><br>"This book is a welcome and much-needed study of three under-represented practitioners and the cultural context in which they worked." (<i>SilicaConversations.com</i>)<br><br>"To be sure, <i>Live Form</i> methodically and effectively remaps the history of postwar American art." (<i>The Art Bulletin</i>)<br><br>"<i>Live Form</i>&nbsp;is an important recovery project that makes exciting connections between the early twentieth-century legacy of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the avant-garde practices of the 1960s and 1970s. . .Sorkin offers a fully fleshed-out exploration of the integral role that women ceramicists played in developing the art of the last century. Her masterful work suggests how many more unrecovered stories of modernism have yet to be told." (<i>CAA Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Sorkin&#x2019;s book is a corrective not only to the history of modern craft, which is still in the early days of its scholarly construction, but to our understanding of feminist methodology and postwar art in general. . . a detailed and ultimately very moving account. . . Sorkin shows us that art history&#x2019;s intrinsic unfairness places hermeneutic demands on us as a profession, ones few have even bothered to consider. Again and again as I read <i>Live Form</i>, I asked myself what (and whom) I might have missed in my own writings, and what I might be able to do differently in the future. I also found renewed belief in the importance of craft-based narratives." (<i>Art Journal</i>)<br><br>"Connective, persuasive and inspiring, this remarkable study maps new ways of looking and understanding post-war art, with craft and community as salve to war, gender inequality and the unmoored nature of<br> modernity itself." (<i>The Burlington</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Delving into seminal events and underappreciated practitioners, Sorkin&#x2019;s groundbreaking research illuminates the significant role that women and the rise of creative communities occupied in the development and transformation of American ceramics during the modern era. Engaging and authoritative, <i>Live Form</i> is an indispensable history that should be required reading for those seriously interested in the history of craft.&#x201d; (Cindi Strauss, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston)</p><h2>The Law and Practice of Marine Insurance and Average (2 volume set)</h2><p>This is the only truly comprehensive work on marine insurance in the United States published since the last edition of Phillips on Insurance in 1867.

Although it originated in Japan as a means of restraint and torture, during the last hundred years it has also been used as an activity which gives emotional, physical, and visual pleasure for the participants. Nawashi Murakawa, the Artistic Director of the annual London festival of the Art of Japanese Rope Bondage provides the historical context for the practice which goes back 12000 years. He also explains how Kinbaku has developed as a dramatic art form which is performed in front of audiences in many countries. <br><br>This series of ten chapters demonstrates how the art of rope bondage has developed in the UK, Russia, Canada and the USA as well as presenting a modern day live performance in Tokyo.

She now considers herself a native Californian, having moved to Los Angeles when freeways and smog were relatively new concepts. During her childhood and adolescence, she spent carefree summers i na small farming community in northwest Iowa. After receiving a B.A. and an M.A. in comparative literature from the University of Southern California, she began teaching composition and reading at City College of San Francisco. She continues to tutor students in reading and composition and to conduct teacher-preparation workshops for the college. In addition to her primary interests - reading and studying Italian - she and her husband David enjoy cooking, watching movies (there are over 100 titles in their Netflix queue), kayaking in Princeton Harbor, camping (especially in the Gold Lakes Basin area of Northern California), and searching out inexpensive ethnic restaurants.

We see the poet lost in a dark wood, and promptly confronted by three mighty beasts: a leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf. Symbolic of sinful behaviour and desires, the trio of creatures pursue Dante into darkness, wherein Virgil - a deceased Roman poet representing human cognition and reason - appears. <br><br> Initially unsure of Virgil's intentions, Dante is persuaded when the poet mentions that Beatrice Portinari, a young woman Dante knew and a symbol of love, sent him to find Dante with instructions from the Virgin Mary. It is thus that their journey to the underworld begins, with Virgil to act as Dante's guide through the malevolent environs. <br><br> It is in this work that Dante's famed division of the Hellish realms, the Nine Circles, are detailed. These layers of the underworld each carry a particular type of sinner, with the punishments and agony ascending in intensity the deeper the descent. The poem reaches its stunning finale in the very core of Hell and the discovery of Lucifer - the Devil. <br><br> This edition contains the well-regarded translation into English by <b>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</b>, whose lifelong passion for Dante's work is translated supremely in every stanza and page of this volume.</p><p>Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 in Florence to a family of minor nobility. He entered into Florentine politics in 1295, but he and his party were forced into exile in a hostile political climate in 1301. Taking asylum in Ravenna late in life, Dante completed his Divine Commedia, considered one of the most important works of Western literature, before his death in 1321.</p><h2>Gray&#39;s Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice (Gray&#39;s Anatomy (British Ed.))</h2><p>Not since it first published in 1858 has Gray's Anatomy introduced so much innovation to the world of anatomical references.

Each book includes educational tools alongside the text, enabling students and readers alike to gain a deeper and more developed understanding of the writer and their work.<br><br>When <i>The Awakening</i> was first published in 1899, critical outcry proved so vociferous that the novel was banned for decades. Now praised as a classic of early feminist literature, Kate Chopin&#x2019;s final work rejects conventional female roles and celebrates a woman&#x2019;s journey towards self-awareness. As the heroine, Edna Pontellier, awakens to her own desires, she begins to question her ideas about marriage, motherhood, society, art, and the nature of love itself. A milestone in American fiction, <i>The Awakening</i> is an unforgettably poignant novel of self-discovery that has inspired generations of readers.<br> <br>Enriched Classics enhance your engagement by introducing and explaining the historical and cultural significance of the work, the author&#x2019;s personal history, and what impact this book had on subsequent scholarship.

There they discover a city in the midst of revolution, bustling with gay men in search of liberation&#x2015;few of whom are raising a child. <p>Steve throws himself into San Francisco&#x2019;s vibrant cultural scene. He takes Alysia to raucous parties, pushes her in front of the microphone at poetry readings, and introduces her to a world of artists, thinkers, and writers. But the pair live like nomads, moving from apartment to apartment, with a revolving cast of roommates and little structure. As a child Alysia views her father as a loving playmate who can transform the ordinary into magic, but as she gets older Alysia wants more than anything to fit in. The world, she learns, is hostile to difference.</p><p>In Alysia&#x2019;s teens, Steve&#x2019;s friends&#x2015;several of whom she has befriended&#x2015;fall ill as AIDS starts its rampage through their community. While Alysia is studying in New York and then in France, her father tells her it&#x2019;s time to come home; he&#x2019;s sick with AIDS. Alysia must choose whether to take on the responsibility of caring for her father or continue the independent life she has worked so hard to create.</p><p>Reconstructing their life together from a remarkable cache of her father&#x2019;s journals, letters, and writings, Alysia Abbott gives us an unforgettable portrait of a tumultuous, historic time in San Francisco as well as an exquisitely moving account of a father&#x2019;s legacy and a daughter&#x2019;s love.</p> 10 illustrations</p><p>Alysia Abbott&#39;s work has appeared in Real Simple, Salon, and TheAtlantic.com. She is a graduate of the New School&#39;s MFA program and was a contributing producer at WNYC radio. She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her husband and two children.&#x201c;<em>Fairyland</em> is [a] daughter's compassionate, clear-eyed reckoning with [the] truths that defined her singular girlhood at the dawn of the gay liberation movement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alexandra Styron, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In Alysia Abbott&#x2019;s gorgeous account of her 1980s San Francisco childhood, a whimsical gay poet becomes an intelligent father, his motherless daughter a forceful and articulate young woman, and a rich, dizzy fairyland is shuttered by a plague. As a chronicle of the moment when the San Francisco of Armistad Maupin became the city of Harvey Milk, when gay and experimental poetry flourished in California, <em>Fairyland</em> is vivid and indelible. As the portrait of a conspiracy of love between a father and a daughter, it is heartrending, a brilliant addition to the literature of American memoir.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Honor Moore, Author of <i>The Bishop&#x2019;s Daughter</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The striking photo on the cover of <em>Fairyland</em> looks like it could have been taken one hundred years ago. It gives a sense of the otherworldly childhood that Abbott recounts in this memoir about growing up with her openly gay, single father in San Francisco in the nineteen-seventies and eighties. The memoir doubles as a portrait of a city and a community at a crucial point in history. Her memoir is funny, strange, and sweet&#x2015; she remembers playing dress-up with her father's flamboyant friends, learning about sex and gender without a mother, being immersed in art and creativity and, finally, watching as the AIDS epidemic decimated the life she knew.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A vivid, sensitively written account of a complex but always loving relationship. This is not only a painfully honest autobiography but also a tribute to old-fashioned bohemian values in a world that is increasingly conformist and materialistic. I couldn't put it down!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edmund White, author of <i>A Boy's Own Story</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Generous, precise, and deeply moving, <em>Fairyland</em> is a love story that not only brings a new generational perspective to a history we&#x2019;re in danger of forgetting, but irrevocably shifts the way we think about family itself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alison Bechdel, author of <i>Are You My Mother?</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;At once a father-daughter love story, a testament to survival, a meditation on profound loss, and a searing chronicle of a complex coming of age, <em>Fairyland</em> is a beautiful, haunting book that instructs, even as it breaks our hearts.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dani Shapiro, author of <i>Devotion: A Memoir</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Clear-eyed and heartrending, <em>Fairyland</em> captures a singular time and place in American history. It also captures something much more important: what it means to be truly loved&#x2015;and to love truly. A beautiful book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew McCarthy, author of <i>The Longest Way Home</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Insightful and well-crafted, this book is useful both as a memoir and as a historical portrait of one of America's oldest gay communities.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Alysia beautifully remembers the innocence of the age between the disappearance of the Beats and the onset of AIDS.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As a chronicle of American culture, Abbott's story matters.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Boston Globe</em></strong></p><h2>Language Arts, Grade 3 (Interactive Notebooks)</h2><p>In Interactive Notebooks: Language Arts for third grade, students will complete hands-on activities about main idea, author&#39;s purpose, text features, editing, parts of speech, context clues, vocabulary, and more.

Use cases have gained widespread acceptance because they make requirements less ambiguous by specifying exactly when and under what conditions certain behaviors occur. As a result, those who effective employ use cases to model their systems can better deliver projects on time, within budget, and with fewer defects. However, use case modeling is not that easy; it is a practice that comes with characteristics that can impact a project. In this new book, the authors allow you to benefit from their considerable experience making use cases work well in a number of different environments. With the advice, tips, and tricks presented herein, the reader will be further along the path to understanding and exploiting the power of use cases, and ultimately constructing better applications. In writing this book, the authors have worked closely with use case founder Ivar Jacobson, and the book is unique in that it presents a Rational Software Corporation-centric examination of this topic.</p></p><p><p>Developers who effectively employ use cases deliver better applications--on time and under budget. The concept behind use cases is perhaps as old as software itself; they express the behavior of systems in terms of how users will ultimately interact with them.

Set in the rich farmland of the Salinas Valley, California, this powerful, often brutal novel, follows the interwined destinies of two families - the Trasks and the Hamiltons - whose generations hopelessly re-enact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Here Steinbeck created some of his most memorable characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of indentity; the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.</p><p>John Steinbeck knew and understood America and Americans better than any other writer of the twentieth century.

The author argues that there are three major influences which determine the verse-forms used in any language: the natural rhythm of the spoken language itself; the properties of rhythmic form; and the metrical conventions which have grown up within the literary tradition. He investigates these in order to explain the forms of English verse, and to show how rhythm and metre work as an essential part of the reader&#39;s experience of poetry.</p><p>&#34;Dr Attridge&#39;s excellent bookxxx;is written by a man with a good ear and sensibility for poetry and it is written clearly.&#34; British Journal of Aesthetics</p><h2>Psychophysical Acting: An Intercultural Approach after Stanislavski</h2><p><p><em>Psychophysical Acting</em> is a direct and vital address to the demands of contemporary theatre on today&#x2019;s actor.

Yeats: A Life, Vol. 1)</h2><p>William Butler Yeats has cast his long shadow over the history of both modern poetry and modern Ireland for so long that his preeminence is taken for granted. Now, in the first authorized biography of Yeats to appear in over fifty years, leading Irish historian R.F. Foster travels beyond Yeats's towering image as arguably the century's greatest poet to restore a real sense of Yeats's extraordinary life as Yeats himself experienced it--what he saw, what he did, the passions and the petty squabbles that consumed him, and his alchemical ability to transmute the events of his crowded and contradictory life into enduring art.<br> In the first volume of this long-awaited biography, Foster covers the poet's first fifty years, bringing new light to bear on Yeats's heroic and often ruthless efforts to invent himself as a poet and public figure. Drawn from a fascinating archive of personal and contemporary documents with the cooperation of surviving members of the Yeats family, it dramatically alters long-held assumptions about the poet's background, his relationship with Maud Gonne and other women, and his roles in the great cultural and political upheavals that transformed Ireland in his lifetime. A rich and entertaining account of Yeats's boyhood days amidst the talented but troubled members of the Yeats and Pollexfen clans provides important insight into the poet's deep and lifelong connection to the Irish landscape, his early, impassioned embrace of the nationalist cause, and his later retreat to the traditions of the once grand Protestant aristocracy. In his own day Yeats attracted enemies and admirers with equal passion, and Foster vividly recreates the friendships, love affairs, and simmering rivalries that swirled about the poet's circles in London, Dublin, and Coole Park. Complementing his meticulous scholarship with a shrewd wit and a novelist's eye for detail, he chronicles the romantic disappointments, financial difficulties, experimentation with hashish and mescal, and the growing preoccupation with the occult that prefaced Yeats's attempt to unite Irish politics with high culture and his creation of an Irish national theater. Here are the poet's memorable encounters with many of the most interesting people of his time, including Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, J.M. Synge, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and the wildly diverse leaders of the Irish independence movement. And here at last is a full accounting of the complex bond between Yeats and the incomparable Maud Gonne, revealed as an influence eternally recreated 'like the phoenix,' affecting almost everything he did.<br> Poet, playwright, mystic and revolutionary; lover, confidant, and friend. This brilliant account of the public and private lives of William Butler Yeats illuminates not only the wellspring of his artistic vision, but the modern Irish identity he helped to create. It is essential reading for anyone intrigued by one of the most original and influential voices of the twentieth century.<br></p><p>There are several biographies of the great Irish poet to choose from, and the one you&#39;ll prefer depends on how much biography you want. Subtitled &#34;The Apprentice Mage, 1865-1914,&#34; this is the one for completists (though they&#39;ll have to wait for Volume Two to get through Yeats&#39;s death in 1939). The author, a noted Irish historian, renders Yeats&#39;s life almost day to day, giving a particularly lively sense of the helter-skelter nature of his early years and a nice depiction of his tumultuous engagement with the Abbey Theatre.<br><strong>R.F.

It can accompany James Rachels and Stuart Rachels&#x2019; introductory text, <i>Problems from Philosophy</i>, or it can stand alone with great effectiveness. <i>The Truth about the World</i> and <i>Problems from Philosophy</i> were James Rachels&#x2019; last contributions to philosophy, and each book has been revised by his son, Stuart. In these two books, James Rachels found a culminating expression for his love of philosophy.</p><p><p>James Rachels, the distinguished American moral philosopher, was born in Columbus, Georgia. He&nbsp;graduated from Mercer University in Macon in 1962. He received his PhD in 1967 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He taught at the University of Richmond, New York University, the University of Miami, Duke University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he spent the last twenty-six years of his career. </p><p>1971 saw the publication of Rachels&#x2019; groundbreaking textbook <em>Moral Problems</em>, which ignited the movement in America away from teaching ethical theory towards teaching concrete practical issues. <em>Moral Problems</em> sold 100,000 copies over three editions. In 1975, Rachels wrote &#x201c;Active and Passive Euthanasia,&#x201d; arguing that the distinction so important in the law between killing and letting die has no rational basis. Originally appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, this essay has been reprinted roughly 300 times and is a staple of undergraduate education. <em>The End of Life</em> (1986) was about the morality of killing and the value of life. <em>Created from Animals </em>(1990) argued that a Darwinian world-view has widespread philosophical implications, including drastic implications for our treatment of nonhuman animals. <em>Can Ethics Provide Answers?</em> (1997) was Rachels&#x2019; first collection of papers (others are expected posthumously). Rachels&#x2019; McGraw-Hill textbook, <em>The Elements of Moral Philosophy</em>, is now in its fourth edition and is easily the best-selling book of its kind.</p><p>Over his career, Rachels wrote 5 books and 85 essays, edited 7 books and gave about 275 professional lectures. His work has been translated into Dutch, Italian, Japanese, and Serbo-Croatian. James Rachels is widely admired as a stylist, as his prose is remarkably free of jargon and clutter. A major theme in his work is that reason can resolve difficult moral issues. He has given reasons for moral vegetarianism and animal rights, for affirmative action (including quotas), for the humanitarian use of euthanasia, and for the idea that parents owe as much moral consideration to other people&#x2019;s children as they do to their own. James Rachels died of cancer on September 5th, 2003, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><br><br>Stuart Rachels&nbsp;is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Alabama. He has revised several of James Rachels&#x2019; books, including <em>Problems from Philosophy</em> (second edition, 2009) and <em>The Right Thing to Do</em> (fifth edition, 2010), which is the companion anthology to this book.

But nobody knew whether the deal would involve money or blood.<br><br>Harry ran a few riffs along the upper register, eased into bass chords, and glanced at the little cellar trap half-hidden by the piano. Something nervous was happening here tonight.<br><br>He launched into "Crazy Rhythm" for sixteen bars, then downchorded expertly and blended in a touch of "Desert Song," and nobody seemed to notice. He realized that it didn't matter what he played, as long as he kept playing. Nobody was listening to the music. They would listen only if he quit.<br><br>Harry Sheffield was used to being lonely. It was a way of life for him, and he had about given up on any miracles coming along to change that. But the young pianist felt lonelier than usual tonight, alone on that lighted bandstand while out in the shadowy clubroom men with $200 suits and hidden guns glared at one another across an empty dance floor.<br><br>He noticed then that the waiters and busboys had all disappeared. Something was happening here.<br><br>Maybe it was because of the bandstand rise that Harry saw what no one else in the place seemed to see--a sudden swirling, coalescing shift of reality in the little corridor leading to the kitchen. For an instant, in that little space, existence seemed to spin, whirl, and collapse inward upon itself. An instant only, then there was a man there, suspended three feet above the floor. In the instant Harry saw him he dropped to the floor, crouching, then ducked behind a velvet drape.<br><br>"Desert Song" became the overture from "Die Walk�rie," and Harry didn't even notice it.<br><br>Across the club, the big oaken door opened and three McGintys edged in, two with their hands under the coats and one--Seamus himself--carrying a leather satchel.<br><br>All hell seemed to break loose at that moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange man from the kitchen corridor appeared at a booth alcove, holding a lethal-looking something with a red light on top of it. He lunged and pivoted, grabbed the valise from Seamus McGinty, and whirled around.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two McGintys went down as though they had been poleaxed, and the man with the odd weapon sprinted three steps toward the kitchen, then doubled over the outstretched foot of a small, dark-haired woman whose sable wrap was thrown aside to expose a large, semiautomatic handgun with an elaborate red-light beamer of its own.<br><br>"Drop and spread 'em, Bozo!" she ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're under arrest!"<br><br>Across the room, a man in some kind of uniform stepped out from between rubber plants, swinging a red-light gun this way and that.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everybody just stay calm," he ordered. "It's TEC business."<br><br>For an instant, the scene was a frozen tableau...followed by chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been Seamus McGinty who opened the ball, or it might have been Vicente Spirelli.&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly there were guns everywhere, and everybody was shooting at everybody else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry Sheffield dived behind the piano. The roar of gunfire in the Phoenix Club was deafening.&nbsp;&nbsp;It ebbed slightly, and Harry peeked out to see bodies sprawled everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were moving and some weren't.&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl with the sable wrap was crawling toward the bandstand, leaving a little trail of blood behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp;On impulse, the musician broke from cover just as someone kicked the girl viciously and stood over her, leveling a gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Bozo, the man who had first materialized in the kitchen corridor.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cry Harry sprinted two steps, launched himself, and smashed into the man, who didn't see him coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bozo fell, dropping his gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry followed, almost blind with rage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The man had assaulted a helpless, injured woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering that vicious kic<br>k, Harry swung a roundhouse blow that smashed into Bozo's face, then hit him again, as hard as he could.&nbsp;&nbsp;The man went limp, and Harry turned to the girl and picked her up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunfire erupted again, and he ducked and ran, back to the cover of the piano.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was almost unconscious, bleeding from a head wound, but even through the blood and the stink of gunpowder Harry realized that never in his life had he seen anyone so beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the trap, eased her down through it, and crawled in after her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath, the crawlway was a service ledge dropping to a small cellar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above them, muffled now, a few more gunshots echoed; then there was silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cellar gloom she looked up at him with dazed, unfocused dark eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me," she whispered.<br><br>"I'm trying to, miss," Harry said.<br><br>"Where's Cole?" she slurred, struggling for consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;"My partner .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;and the jumper .&nbsp;&nbsp;. . where are they?"<br><br>Harry eased the trap open, peering out.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phoenix reeked of gunsmoke and silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were bloody bodies everywhere. Raising his head, he saw the man he had hit, sprawled now across a table with part of his head missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the room, beyond fallen Spirellis and McGintys, the man with the red-light gun lay half-upright against a velvet-draped wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody was dead.<br><br>Just beneath him, the girl's slurred voice sounded frantic.&nbsp;&nbsp;"The anomalies!&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather up the anomalies!"<br><br>"The what?"<br><br>"The .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;things that don't belong in this time," she managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please .&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;."<br><br>Harry crawled from the trap, skirted the piano, and made the rounds, stepping over dead gangsters. He found three of the odd-looking red-light guns, a thing like a padlock with a radio dial, and a strange bracelet strapped to the dead uniformed man's wrist.<br><br>He gathered these and returned to the trap, closing the lid just as the club's front doors burst open to the sounds of shouts and stern voices.<br><br>In the little cellar off the stage crawlway, the injured girl tied a sort of tape around all the things Harry had collected, and added a bracelet of her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled away from Harry, feeble fingers trying to manipulate the decoration on one of the bracelets.<br><br>"Here, miss." He took the bundle from her gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me help you with that. What are you trying to do with--"<br><br>"No!&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;." she breathed, and passed out.<br><br>Harry got a grip on the bracelet's raised center, tugged at it and twisted, and suddenly everything around him began to whirl crazily.&nbsp;&nbsp;By reflex he cast the bundle away from him, then watched in wide-eyed awe as the strange things disappeared in a swirling, coalescing instant of indescribable confusion.<br><br>Shouts and footfalls sounded overhead, and Harry knew it was only moments until somebody noticed the floor trap behind the piano.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloom of the tiny cellar he scooped the injured girl up in his arms and ducked around boilers, through pipe tunnels, and into a plumbing shaft.<br><br>He didn't know what had happened in the Phoenix Club, or who was up there now, or what would happen next. But a helpless, bleeding girl with big, dark eyes had asked him to help her, and suddenly there was nothing more important in Harry Sheffield's world than to do what he could for her.<br><br>She needed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry couldn't remember anybody ever needing him before.<br>In the dingy little walk-up that was Harry's home, he cleaned and wrapped her wound--a short, bleeding scar just above the left temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensitive fingers told him her skull was sound, but the concussion was precarious. He wrapped her in blankets and held her close as waves of delayed shock racked her.<br><br>Doc Walker came from down the street, examined her, and shrugged.&nbsp;&nbsp;...</p><h2>Bates&#39; Guide to Physical Examination And History Taking (9th Edition)</h2><p><p>Now in its Ninth Edition, this classic text provides the best foundation for performing physical examination and taking the patient history.

No? When you have finished this book, you are going to be very surprised; you are going to know some things about yourself that you never knew before. We use coercion almost exclusively to control each other; many find it hard to imagine any other way. The author asks, Does the death penalty deter potential murderers? Is harsh retaliation the answer to the discipline problem in our schools? Do the standard coercive practices work? - in law enforcement, behavior therapy, education, the family, business, the armed forces, diplomacy. Behavior analysis has shown that they do not work. Coercion is in the long run self-defeating. Punishment eventually proves counterproductive. Sidman presents a rational discussion of matters in which emotions usually run strong.

Dwight Weaver has been fascinated by Missouri&#x2019;s caves since boyhood and now distills a lifetime of exploration and research in a book that will equally fascinate readers of all ages.</p><p><i>Missouri Caves in History and Legend</i> records a cultural heritage stretching from the end of the ice age to the twenty-first century.&nbsp; In a grand tour of the state&#x2019;s darkest places, Weaver takes readers deep underground to shed light on the historical significance of caves, correct misinformation about them, and describe the ways in which people have used and abused these resources.</p><p>Weaver tells how these underground places have enriched our knowledge of extinct animals and early Native Americans. He explores the early uses of caves: for the mining of saltpeter, onyx, and guano; as sources of water; for cold storage; and as livestock shelters. And he tells how caves were used for burial sites and moonshine stills, as hideouts for Civil War soldiers and outlaws&#x2014;revealing how Jesse James became associated with Missouri caves&#x2014;and even as venues for underground dance parties in the late nineteenth century.</p><p>Bringing caves into the modern era, Weaver relates the history of Missouri&#x2019;s &#x201c;show caves&#x201d; over a hundred years&#x2014;from the opening of Mark Twain Cave in 1886 to that of Onyx Mountain Caverns in 1990&#x2014;and tells of the men and women who played a major role in expanding the state&#x2019;s tourism industry. He also tracks the hunt for the buried treasure and uranium ore that have captivated cave explorers, documents the emergence of organized caving, and explains how caves now play a role in wildlife management by providing a sanctuary for endangered bats and other creatures.</p><p>Included in the book is an overview of cave resources in twelve regions, covering all the counties that currently have recorded caves, as well as a superb selection of photos from the author&#x2019;s extensive collection, depicting the history and natural features of these underground wonders. <i>Missouri Caves in History and Legend</i> is a riveting account that marks an important contribution to the state&#x2019;s heritage and brings this world of darkness into the light of day.</p></p><p>Former show cave operator H.

It kills two out of every three people it infects. The World Health Organization warns that it is on the verge of mutating into a super-contagious pandemic form that could visit several billion homes within two years.<br><br>In this urgent and extraordinarily frightening book, Mike Davis reconstructs the scientific and political history of a viral apocalypse in the making, exposing the central roles of agribusiness and the fast-food industries, abetted by corrupt governments, in creating the ecological conditions for the emergence of this new plague. He also details the scandalous failure of the Bush administration, obsessed with hypothetical "bio-terrorism," to safeguard Americans from the greatest biological threat since HIV/AIDS.</p><p>The virus known as H5N1 is now endemic among poultry and wild bird populations in East Asia. A flu strain of astonishing lethality, it has a talent for transforming itself to foil the human immune system&#x2014;and kills two out of every three people it infects. The World Health Organization now warns that avian flu is on the verge of mutating info a super-contagious form that could travel at pandemic velocity, killing up to 100 million people in two years. <br><br>In The Monster at Our Door, the first book to sound this alarm, our foremost urban and environmental critic reconstructs the scientific and political history of this viral apocalypse in the making, exposing the central roles played by burgeoning slums, the agribusiness and fast-food industries, and corrupt governments. Mike Davis tracks the avian flu crisis as the virus moves west and the world remains woefully unprepared to contain it. With drug companies unwilling to invest inessential vaccines, severe shortages persist, a scenario Davis compares to the sinking <i>Titanic</i>: there are virtually no lifesaving resources available to the poor, and precious few for the rich, too.<br>MacArthur fellow <b>Mike Davis</b> is the author of several books, including <i>City of Quartz, Ecology of Fear, Late Victorian Holocausts, Dead Cities</i>, and&#x2014;with Kelly Mayhew and Jim Miller&#x2014;<i>Under the Perfect Sun</i>.

The articles span seven decades and encompass interests at home and abroad.</p><p><br> <b>GRAHAM GREENE</b> wrote over 50 books, including such modern classics as <i>Our Man in Havana</i>, <i>The Quiet American</i>, <i>The End of the Affair</i>, <i>The Heart of the Matter</i>, <i>The End of the Affair</i> and <i>The Power and the Glory</i>. Born in Birkhamsted, England, he lived in Paris and Antibes before his death in April 1991.Like the recent Last Stories , this is a collection of previously uncollected material--in this case essays, reviews and travel pieces from the entire length of the author's 60-year writing career (the earliest written while he was still at Oxford). The material varies considerably in interest and quality, though it is surprising to observe that from the start the eye for the telling, often sordid detail was at work, the knack for establishing atmosphere in a deft stroke or two. The travel pieces are superbly crafted essays, combining politics and sociology seamlessly with history and scenery: on Indo-China before the Vietnam War, on old and new Cuba, on Haiti, Paraguay, a haunting evocation of Goa. Greene also wrote passionately and despairingly on the possibilities--and mostly failed promise--of film; a movie critic in the '30s, he was one of the best. A collection like this does not add to his reputation but is interesting, nonetheless, for the consistency of his dour vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Native Americans (American Political History)</h2><p><p>Using both contributed essays from eminent scholars and excerpts of primary source documents with explanatory headnotes, the new reference series, <em>American Political History,</em> will focus on broad-based issues in American political history. </p> <p>The first title in the series explores the political history of Native Americans.

When she arrived in Canada at the age of sixteen, she felt unstable and adrift in an unfamiliar place. Nevertheless, she completed her education, and went on to become a teacher as well as a doctoral candidate in educational leadership. Her first students, a group of young refugees, led her back to her original passion: writing. She began to heal her sixteen-year-old self by writing to heal her students. Since self-publishing her first collection of poetry and prose in 2016, Najwa has become an inspiration to millions of people worldwide.

Roman achievements in architecture, law, politics, literature, war, and philosophy serve as the foundation of modern Western society. Now, for the first time in an A-Z format, <em>A Dictionary</em> <em>of the Roman Empire</em> assembles the people, places, events, and ideas of this remarkable period in one easy-to-use source. With over 1,900 entries covering more than five hundred years of Roman history, from Julius Caesar and the Gallic Wars (59-51 B.C.) to the fall of Romulus Augustus, the last Roman emperor (476 A.D.), this accessible guide provides quick reference to one of the most studied periods of all antiquity.<br> Every aspect of Roman life is included. Here are profiles of the great emperors, such as Marcus Aurelius, one of the most profoundly intellectual monarchs in western civilization, and the aberrant Gaius Caligula, who, after draining the Roman treasury with his eccentric behavior, made it a capital crime for citizens not to bequeath him their estates. Informative entries describe the complex workings of Roman government, such as census taking, the creation of civil service, coinage, and the venerable institution of the Senate, and offer insight into the various trends and cultural tastes that developed throughout Roman history. For example, a discussion on baths, the most common type of building in the Roman Empire, demonstrates the unique intermingling of luxury, community, recreation, and, in the provinces, an association with Rome, that served as the focus of any city aspiring to greatness. Other entries describe the practice of paganism, marriage and divorce, ludi (public games held to entertain the Roman populace), festivals of the Roman year, and gluttony (epitomized by famous gourmands such as the emperor Vitellius, who according to the historian Suetonius, lived for food, banqueting three or four times a day, routinely vomiting up his meal and starting over). Also featured are longer essays on such topics as art and architecture, gods and goddesses, and the military, as well as a chronology, a short glossary of Roman terms, and appendices listing the emperors of the Empire and diagram the often intertwined family trees of ruling dynasties. <br> Comprehensive, authoritative, and illustrated with over sixty illustrations and maps, <em>A Dictionary of the Roman Empire</em> provides easy access to the remarkable civilization upon which Western society was built.<br></p><p><br><strong>Matthew Bunson</strong>, a long-time student of the Roman Empire, is the author of over a dozen books, including the forthcoming <em>Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages</em>.

He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>Advancing Formative Assessment in Every Classroom: A Guide for Instructional Leaders</h2><p>Formative assessment is one of the best ways to increase student learning and enhance teacher quality. But effective formative assessment is not part of most classrooms, largely because teachers misunderstand what it is and don't have the necessary skills to implement it.<br> <br>In this practical guide for school leaders, authors Connie M. Moss and Susan M. Brookhart define formative assessment as an active, continual process in which teachers and students work together--every day, every minute--to gather evidence of learning, always keeping in mind three guiding questions: Where am I going? Where am I now? What strategy or strategies can help me get to where I need to go? Chapters focus on the six elements of formative assessment: (1) sharing learning targets and criteria for success, (2) feedback that feeds forward, (3) student goal setting, (4) student self-assessment, (5) strategic teacher questioning, and (6) engaging students in asking effective questions.<br> <br>Using specific examples based on their extensive work with teachers, the authors provide<br> <br>* 'Strategic talking points'; and 'conversation starters'; to address common misconceptions about formative assessment;<br>* Practical classroom strategies to share with teachers;<br>* Ways to model the elements of formative assessment in conversations with teachers about their professional learning;<br>* 'What if'; scenarios and advice for how to deal with them; and<br>* Questions for reflection to gauge understanding and progress.<br> <br>As Moss and Brookhart emphasize, the goal is not to 'do'; formative assessment, but to embrace a major cultural change that moves away from teacher-led instruction to a 'partnership of intentional inquiry'; between student and teacher, with better teaching and learning as the outcome.</p><p>Making formative assessment the norm in every classroom throughout your school is much easier when you have this book&#x2019;s clear guidelines and simple steps. Using examples from their extensive work with teachers, the authors give you the strategic talking points, conversation starters, and ready-made tools you need to address common misconceptions about the process, connect formative assessment to improving student motivation, and share formative assessment strategies that teachers can easily incorporate into everyday lessons.Susan M. Brookhart, Ph.D., is an independent educational consultant and author based in Helena, Montana. Dr. Brookhart&#39;s interests include the role of both formative and summative classroom assessment in student motivation and achievement, the connection between classroom assessment and large-scale assessment, and grading. She was the 2007-2009 editor of Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice, a journal of the National Council on Measurement in Education. She is author or co-author of 16 books and more than 60 articles and book chapters on classroom assessment,teacher professional development, and evaluation.

It is ideal for the individual seeking a hands-on approach to understanding structure, nomenclature, physical properties, uses and applications, and chemical reactions of organic compounds. <b></b> Unique engaging techniques get the reader involved in the learning process, such as a "Getting Involved" feature at the end of each section and several dozen mini-essays which connect theory to real life issues. <b></b> Ideal for medical health professionals and anyone involved in consumer health issues. </p></p><p>Drawing on the authors&#39; 25 years of teaching experience, this text has been specifically designed for the unique needs and interests of students taking a short course in organic chemistry. It introduces carefully selected core concepts of organic chemistry, brings them together with unifying principles, and relates them to applications of interest to students and society in general.Preface <p> It is a privilege to present the sixth edition of our introductory organic chemistry textbook coincidentally with the beginning of the twenty-first century. We have been honored by opportunities for revision, translations into other languages, and the use of this textbook in many parts of the world as well as the United States. Our appreciation goes to the thousands of students and faculty members who have used this book during its 22-year history. Thank you; this experience has been a special part of our professional and personal lives. </p><p> The following is a description of the focus and approach of Organic Chemistry, as well as how students and their instructors might best use the textbook. </p><p> This treatment of organic chemistry is designed for a short course that consists of one quarter, one semester, or two quarters. It is written especially for students who are not chemistry majors but are in fields for which chemistry is a core course. Accordingly, we have limited the scope of the presentation and have introduced applications related to agriculture, life sciences, health and medicine, and consumer, environmental, and societal issues. The selection and organization of material is consistent with this short course focus. For each topic and concept we have tried to write clear and thorough explanations that promote understanding and critical thinking. We have tried to focus on the learning process, and to write in a way to engage the student intellectually. The facts learned in a college course are important, but the promotion of active learning and the appreciation for the material will outlast memorization. </p><p> Most introductory organic chemistry courses are organized around a functional group approach in which molecules with specific structural units (functional groups) are classified in families that share similar physical and chemical properties and rules of nomenclature. Using the functional group approach we have organized the chapters as follows: Organization </p><p> Chapters 1 to 3: The basis for structure and nomenclature. Structure and nomenclature of organic compounds are inextricably related. Competency in these areas is essential if students are to understand and appreciate the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds or to develop a practical understanding of applications. These topics are a major portion of every chapter of the book as each functional group is presented. </p><p> In Chapter 1, structure and bonding are organized around just a few ideas, and each is clearly presented with the interrelationships shown. Chapter 2 covers the structure and nomenclature of alkanes including cycloalkanes and conformational isomers. Chapter 3 presents the structure and nomenclature of alkenes and includes a discussion of geometric isomerism. A wealth of exercises accompany each chapter to allow the student a hands-on experience with structure and nomenclature. </p><p> Chapter 4: An Introduction to Organic Reactions. The basic simplicity of organic chemistry is illustrated here: three types of reactions - substitution, addition, and elimination; three types of mechanisms - carbocation, carbanion, and free radical; and a rather short list of structural features that are considered reaction sites. A free radical substitution reaction of alkanes and a carbocation elimination reaction for the preparation of alkenes conclude the chapter. </p><p> Chapters 5 and 6: Reactions of Alkenes, Alkynes, and Aromatic Compounds. Based on structural concepts covered in Chapters 1 to 3 and the principles of organic reactions from Chapter 4, addition and substitution reactions, both with carbocation mechanisms, are presented in these chapters. </p><p> Chapters 7 and 8: Stereochemistry and Organic Halides. Chirality, enantiomerism, diastereomerism, and R,S configurations are presented in Chapter 7; a concluding short section relates these concepts to reactions already presented. Chapter 8 then uses the principles of organic reactions and stereochemistry in the </p><p>study of nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions. </p><p> Chapters 9 and 10: Alcohols and Ethers; Amines. There are two reasons we place these chapters here. The concepts of acidity and basicity provide a conceptual thread that is clearly evident in both chapters, and the characteristic reactions of nucleophilic substitution and elimination continue nicely from Chapter 8. </p><p> Chapters 11 to 13: Aldehydes and Ketones; Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives. After three chapters involving nucleophilic substitution reactions, we can now concentrate on nucleophilic addition using aldehydes and ketones (Chapter 11). Chapter 12 focuses on the nomenclature and acidity of carboxylic acids. Then in Chapter 13, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions of carboxylic acids and their derivatives are presented. The concepts of acidity and basicity often difficult for students-as well as the nucleophilic reactions begun in Chapters 8, 9, and 10 are reiterated and reinforced. </p><p> Chapters 14 to 17: Biochemistry - Carbohydrates, Fats and Oils, Proteins, and Nucleic Acids. The functional groups and reactions introduced in Chapters 9 to 13 lead logically to chapters on biomolecules. In keeping with the interests of the students in this course, we cover each of these topics in some detail. </p><p> Chapter 18: Spectroscopy. Infrared ultraviolet-visible, proton and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry are presented concisely but in a way that allows significant experiences in problem solving. We realize that many instructors do not cover this chapter while others cover it at different places in the course. We have organized the material so this chapter can be introduced any time after Chapter 6 based on the student's knowledge of structure (Chapter 13 is another logical place for introduction because all the functional groups have been presented). </p><p> Connections boxes: There are more than 40 essays throughout the book written to connect organic chemistry to the real world. They include topics related to issues of energy, the environment, consumer goods, living organisms, health, disease, and medicine. Pedagogy </p><p> The following are learning tools available in this textbook:</p><p>Getting Involved: These special entries follow all major sections of each chapter and many of the subsections. Within these we try to engage the student in her/his own learning process. Each Getting Involved module will have one or more sections in the following order: Short questions: These questions are a first opportunity for a student to self-evaluate his or her comprehension of what was just read. Worked examples: Often there will be a worked example in this section. Other times there will be sufficient examples in the preceding reading. Practice problems: These provide an opportunity to work immediately with the material just presented. Reference to end-of-chapter problems: The internal textbook problems are immediate opportunities to "get involved." Appropriate, related problems from the end of the chapter are referenced here. Clear and complete explanations: We have emphasized a depth of understanding rather than breadth in this text. An emphasis on systematic, logical, and critical thinking minimizes memorization and maximizes real learning. Problems: Organic chemistry is a hands-on subject. A student has to work problems to really become adept with the material. This book has approximately 800 numbered problems distributed between in-chapter and end-of-chapter exercises. Included with these problems are some molecular model-building exercises that can be done with a variety of different model kits or with electronic model programs like Chem3D (Cambridge Soft). If you are interested, Prentice Hall can make model kits of Chem3D available with this text at a dramatic discount. Marginal definitions: A brief definition of each important term is printed in the margin next to its introduction. Reaction summaries: Summaries of all reactions are presented at the end of each chapter. Summary of IUPAC nomenclature: See the Appendix for this comprehensive, integrated summary. Glossary of terms: This appendix is an alphabetical listing of the terms defined in the margins in each chapter. </p><p> Other special features of this textbook include the following:</p><p>Soft cover, a second color: This textbook is significantly lighter and less expensive than hard-cover versions, and therefore is not as heavy a burden physically or economically. We are offering an alternative, especially when the cost of textbooks is such an issue on college campuses. We believe we have the explanations, illustrations, use of a second color, and exercises to provide a substantial intellectual experience and effectively promote learning. Subdivisions: We realize that instructors have their own creative organizational methods for teaching organic chemistry and that no textbook can exactly match the preferences of many, if any, instructors. We have included subheadings within each chapter to make assignment of topics and exercises, development of a course syllabus, and adaptation of this book to many teaching styles as easy as possible. Solutions Manual and Study Guide (ISBN 0-13-015480-6): An ancillary Solutions Manual and Study Guide is available that contains chapter summaries (outlined just as are the chapters) and solutions to each problem in the textbook. To ensure a consistent voice and style, we wrote this manual ourselves. Website at www prenhall/bailey: We have a companion Website developed by us and specifically designed for this textbook. We suspect it will always be a work in progress, but initially it will have the following features: Links to interesting Websites providing additional information and insight for each of the Connections essays. A tutorial on the use of Chem3D. Demonstration exercises on structure, isomerism, and stereochemistry. </p><p> We wish to thank our students and other users of the previous five editions of this text.

But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.&#x201d; Yet although many believe they sincerely seek the kingdom of God, they do not experience the added things. Why? Joel Goldsmith&#x2019;s book Seek Ye First illumines the inner, true meaning of that familiar Bible passage in unique way that will elicit a resounding &#x201c;A-ha!&#x201d; in those who have struggled to understand it.Goldsmith says that we do not experience the fruitage of the biblical promise because we hold onto erroneous concepts of God and prayer. We pray to God for things or we try to attain them through mental work. Before we can experience the grace of the &#x201c;added things,&#x201d; he says, we must first correct our concepts. Goldsmith proceeds to re-educate the reader on the nature of God and the nature of prayer as he masterfully goes through the spiritual principles and practices revealed in The Infinite Way.The author asserts, &#x201c;God&#x2019;s grace can reach us only as we are attuned to the kingdom of God within.&#x201d; Emphasizing that meditation is the way to come into this spiritual attunement, he reveals the secret: we must not go into meditation for anything. We must not go to God for health, wealth, companionship, or a home. We must have no material motive because this is the almost insurmountable barrier to God-realization. We must seek only illumination, the experience of the Christ within. &#x201c;Only when you can stop taking thought for your life, stop praying to a Santa-Claus-God with promises to be good if only He will deliver, will you attain.&#x201d;While this may seem very abstract at first, Goldsmith reminds us that what takes place in our inner world governs our outer world. After we have found that inner Grace and made our inner contact, we awake and find that all things have been added unto us, for the illumined mind is the substance of fulfillment at every level of our existence &#x2013; even the most practical.Those who want to explore the depths of Goldsmith&#x2019;s mystical teaching will find Seek Ye First a trustworthy guide brimming with a wealth of wisdom from his inspired classes.[Note: Seek Ye First is the collection of the 1973 Infinite Way Letters.]</p><p>JOEL S. GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including: The Infinite Way; Practicing the Presence; The Art of Meditation.<p>"A new generation of mature seekers, receptive to spiritual truth, is now discovering Joel Goldsmith's teachings, which have lost none of their relevance, aliveness and power. I foresee that those teachings will reach and impact even more people in the 21st century than during his lifetime. Joel Goldsmith's inspired and profoundly inspiring books represent a vital contribution to the spiritual awakening of humanity." </p><p>-- Eckhart Tolle</p></p><h2>Cracking the AP Calculus BC Exam, 2019 Edition: Practice Tests &amp; Proven Techniques to Help You Score a 5 (College Test Preparation)</h2><p>Make sure you&#x2019;re studying with the most up-to-date prep materials!

From her early childhood in a castle by the sea in Wales evoked as only Elizabeth Goudge can evoke the joys and pangs of childhood to her tragic estrangement from the king and her death in Paris at the age of twenty-eight, Lucy Walter lived to the full a life of intense joy and equally intense drama. Miss Goudge portrays brilliantly a young love almost too ecstatic to bear. Equally moving is her characterization of Lucy a spirited woman caught up in the cataclysmic wars and disruptive revolution of a tumultuous era.

They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images. They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant, actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled by culturally sanctioned impulses&#x2015;which are just as damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. </p><p>Phillips describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and sensationalist corporate media&#x2015;pointing out that for trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a business strategy. She shows how trolls, &#x201c;the grimacing poster children for a socially networked world,&#x201d; align with social media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. <i>This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things </i>isn't only about trolls; it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.</p></p><p>Whitney Phillips is Assistant Professor of Communication, Culture, and Digital Technologies at Syracuse University<p>A fascinating and truly thought-provoking investigation of online trolls&#x2015;their evolution, their rationales, and their actions over the past decade. Whitney Phillips has gone where few of us dare&#x2015;into the heart of trolling activities across the Internet. What she finds is that trolls aren't a world apart from the rest of us&#x2015;they are instead a particular manifestation of contemporary culture, a distorted fun house image of ourselves&#x2015;that we need to confront in order to tackle the complex issues associated with their less savory operations.</p>&#x2015;<b>Mia Consalvo</b>, Canada Research Chair in Games Studies &amp; Design, Concordia University<br><br><p>Given the social anxiety surrounding online antagonism and mischief generally, and the confusion surrounding trolling specifically, it is about time someone wrote this book. Building on deep empirical research, Phillips has given us a rich, comprehensive, and wonderfully engaging account of the identities and practices of trolling, both as a historically situated subculture and as a dynamic of the digital media environment.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jean Burgess</b>, Associate Professor of Digital Media, Queensland University of Technology<br><br><p><i>This Is Why We Can't Have Nice</i> Things gives us an important, critical exploration into the world of trolling&#x2015;that vexed part of the Internet that is simultaneously often too easily dismissed and yet tremendously impactful.

The overarching philosophy of this edition, updated and revised from 1989's DDC 20, is user convenience. More understandable terminology and simpler subdivision practice will be appreciated by classifiers and patrons alike. New faceting makes many subject areas more flexible and expandable. Visible efforts to reduce U.S. bias in wording and structure are welcome. The most extensive revisions (other than updating for changed jurisdictions) occur in Religion, Public Administration, and Life Sciences. In an effort to lessen Christian bias, the standard subdivisions of Christianity have been relocated from 201-209 to Christianity (230-270). A new option puts Old Testaments books in the original Jewish order, and 296 Judaism and 297 Islam have been expanded. Numbers for Public Administration are the same (350-354), but the citation order is changed from jurisdiction/ topic to topic/jurisdiction and subdivision is faceted. The citation order in Biology (570s) also is flipped to process/organism for internal biological processes. Other changes include updated terminology and new topics (rap music, Internet, virtual reality, in-line skating, etc.). The CD-ROM version, Dewey for WindowsTM, has additional index terms and historical notes for changed numbers. If implemented properly, DDC 21 will make browsing more satisfying and classifying easier. Recommended.

It examines how the political ideals of the American Revolution were undermined by the adoption of repressive doctrines of the English monarchial system - the criminalization of criticism against the king, the Parliament, the judiciary, and Christianity. Freedom of speech was dramatically confined, and this law remained unchallenged until well into the twentieth century. This book will be of keen interest to all concerned with the Early Republic, freedom of speech, and evolution of American constitutional jurisprudence. Because it addresses the much-criticized Sedition Act of 1798, one of the most dramatic illustrations of this repressive jurisprudence, the book will also be of interest to Americans concerned about preserving free speech in wartime.</p><p>This volume explains how America adopted the widely deplored Sedition Act of 1798 and how it undermined the political ideals of the American Revolution.

Pearce goes on to celebrate Chesterton's happy childhood and family life, successful marriage, and friendships with Hilaire Belloc, George Bernard Shaw, and other Victorian and 20th-century writers. Also detailed are Chesterton's social and political activism as well as his romanticism and childlike joie de vivre. Pearce draws copiously from Chesterton's published writings and correspondence and from previous biographies, notably those by Maisie Ward, Michael Coren, and Michael Ffinch.

From the first sketch of an idea to appeals to potential collaborators, from detailed documentation of projects to post-disassembly analysis, Hirschhorn's writings mark the trajectories of his work. This volume collects Hirschhorn's widely scattered texts, presenting many in English for the first time.</p><p>In these writings, Hirschhorn discusses the full range of his art, from works on paper to the massive <i>Presence and Production</i> projects in public spaces. &#x201c;Statements and Letters&#x201d; address broad themes of aesthetic philosophy, politics, and art historical commitments. &#x201c;Projects&#x201d; consider specific artworks or exhibitions. &#x201c;Interviews&#x201d; capture the artist in dialogue with Benjamin Buchloh, Jacques Ranci�re, and others. Throughout, certain continuities emerge: Hirschhorn's commitment to quotidian materials; the centrality of political and economic thinking in his work; and his commitment to art in the public sphere. Taken together, the texts serve to trace the artist's ideas and artistic strategies over the past two decades. <i>Critical Laboratory </i>also reproduces, in color, <i>33 Ausstellungen im �ffentlichen Raum 1998&#x2013;1989</i>, an out-of-print catalog of Hirschhorn's earliest works in public space.</p></p><p>Thomas Hirschhorn (b. 1957) is a Swiss artist known for large sculptures and ambitious projects, often constructed of everyday, makeshift materials.<p>In this book, art historians Lee and Foster offer an expertly chosen collection of these disparate texts, many of which appear in English for the first time...His writings are not only engaging but often highly illuminating. For instance, an homage to Andy Warhol offers great insight into Hirschhorn's provocative use of violent war imagery. VERDICT Highly recommended to readers interested in Hirschhorn's work or artist writings more generally.</p>&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><h2>The Encyclopedia of Natural Pet Care</h2><p>Alternative health titles are topping bestseller lists as people search for effective, natural ways to care for themselves and their families--and, as every pet owner knows, house pets are family too.

Unlike texts that describe and detail methods for doing ethnographic and qualitative research once in the field, Book 2 explores in depth the many critical issues that ethnographic researchers need to consider before going to the field and in the earliest stages of the field experience. These include preparation of self, establishing relationships that ensure access to the field, and steps in the construction of a formative theoretical model that will inform the entire research process from start to finish. Following guidelines established in Book 1, the first three chapters describe the reasons why ethnography should be considered a mixed methods approach to social science research. They discuss why theory is important in guiding a study, and the important institutional and personal preparations required to enter a field setting and begin work. Additional chapters debunk the idea that ethnographers always enter the field with their minds a &#x201c;clean slate&#x201d; in terms of what they will find during their investigation. They show why and how researchers can develop initial theoretical models based on local knowledge and literature reviews. Ethnography uses a holistic approach, so such models take into consideration both individual/population and systemic or structural considerations. They lead the way to integrating ecological, empirical, critical, and interpretivist approaches into a comprehensive analysis of a dynamic system. Two chapters also provide detailed examples to illustrate the connection between steps in the modeling process, creation of observational measures, and steps in data collection--from most open-ended kinds of interviewing and observation to the kind of highly structured ethnographic surveying described in Book 3. Extensive illustrative case examples are included. The final chapter shows how the modeling process can be extended to guide the development of interventions and change strategies at multiple levels&#x2014;a process that should be part of any research program. A wide variety of diagrams, instructions, examples, and illustrations make the topics and processes covered in Book 2 easy to read and understand, even by novice researchers. Overall, Book 2 offers a unique mixed methods lens through which to build theory by engaging in research modeling, to enter the field, to set up to gather data, and to anticipate influencing change. <br><br>Other books in the set:<br> <br>Book 1:<br>Designing and Conducting Ethnographic Research: An Introduction, Second Edition<br>by Margaret D.

This diverse tropical region was integrated into a global trade system, while trade-based cities came to dominate its affairs. Its states became more centralized and absolutist, and its people adopted scriptural faiths of personal morality. The pace of these changes finds parallels only in our own era. <br><br>Anthony Reid has analyzed and vividly portrayed this Southeast Asian Age of Commerce in two volumes. The first volume, published in 1988 to great acclaim, explored the physical, material, cultural, and social structures of the region. The concluding volume focuses on the profound changes that defined the Age of Commerce as a period. The spice trade that animated the global boom of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries made possible revolutionary changes in urbanization, commercialization, state structure, and belief. Islam, Christianity, and Theravada Buddhism made rapid gains in alliance with the new states. Reid discerns common ground between these developments and the forces transforming Europe and Japan but identifies particular limitations on the growth of private capital and the stability of states in Southeast Asia. A final chapter explores the crisis in the mid-seventeenth century that disengaged Southeast Asians from the world economy for the next three centuries.<br><br></p><p><b>Anthony Reid</b> is professor of Southeast Asian history, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University.<br><br></p><h2>The Classic: Sainte-Beuve and the Nineteenth-Century Culture Wars</h2><p>Focusing on a moment and a source in nineteenth-century France, Christopher Prendergast takes up a big question that is still with us: <em>What is a classic?</em> The question is, by virtue of its insistent recurrence, itself a classic question. It returns to haunt us. It provided the title of a text for French critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve in 1850 ("Qu'est-ce qu'un classique?"), as it did in the twentieth century for T.S. Eliot and John Coetzee. Centring on Sainte-Beuve in his nineteenth-century context, Prendergast's inquiry takes us historically to many places (antiquity, the middle ages, the seventeenth and eighteenth as well as the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). He also provides an intellectual history that travels across multiple disciplinary territories (in addition to literary criticism and literary history, classical studies, comparative philology, historiography and political thought). <br><br>Against this background, <em>The Classic </em>maps the evolution of Sainte-Beuve's thought from an initially cosmopolitan conception of the classic (close in spirit to Goethe's notion of <em>Weltliteratur</em>) to an increasingly nationalist conception, with a strong emphasis on the heritage of Latinity and France as its principal legatee. This emphasis was taken up by the extreme right in France after Sainte-Beuve's death, in a determined mobilizing of a version of the "classic" on behalf of a proto-fascist agenda. The final chapter deals with this appropriation and ends with a question of our own about Sainte-Beuve's original question: in the light of this bleak history, perhaps the time has come to dispense with the term "classic" altogether.<br></p><p><br>Christopher Prendergast is a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and was the general editor of <em>The Penguin Proust</em><br>...insightful cultural history * Ann Jefferson, Times Literary Supplement * ...splendid study... * David Baguley French Studies *</p><h2>Customer Service Skills for Success</h2><p>Recipient of the 2017 Textbook and Academic Authors Association's Textbook Excellence Award, Customer Service Skills for Success by Robert W.

The exposition is greatly enriched by Campbell's provision of the historical context of Dewey's aims and enquiries". -- James Gouinlock Emory University<p>"Understanding John Dewey will be as useful to those coming to Dewey for the first time as to Dewey specialists. Few scholars combine as well as Campbell does deep knowledge of American intellectual history and skill in philosophical analysis". -- Peter H. Hare Editor, Transactions of the Peirce Society</p><p>"A book not merely readable but elegant and lucid, not merely adequate but exemplary in its scholarship. Campbell's exposition is a skillfully crafted matrix in which Dewey's own words achieve a momentum and clarity seldom achieved in their original settings, while a chorus, composed mostly of Dewey's contemporaries, provide illuminating commentary from Campbell's footnotes". -- International Studies in Philosophy</p></p><p>James Campbell is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toledo.Campbell's comprehensive introduction to John Dewey's thought is a welcome addition to the literature about a thinker who has had such influence on North American education and thought in the 20th century. Beginning with an analysis of Dewey's views of human nature and the roots of those views in the ideas of William James and Charles Darwin, Campbell proceeds to an examination of Dewey's concept of the role of philosophy in human life. The second half of the book focuses on Dewey's social vision and the belief that pervades his writings that humans are social creatures "who, if they are 'not bound together in associations...are monstrosities.'" Apart from the thoroughness of his scholarship, Campbell's writing is clear and precise, making comprehensible even difficult concepts. Wisely, Campbell lets Dewey speak for himself through a judicious use of quotes from a wide selection of his writings. Though others have delved more deeply into various aspects of Dewey's work (viz., his views on the religious life), Campbell offers the best one-volume exposition of Dewey to come along in some time. Its appearance now, when Dewey's collected works have at last appeared in print, is most timely. Recommended for all academic and large public libraries.?Terry Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

This volume, combining text by Woodman, and by those who knew her, with many of her unpublished images, shows her intense relation with the camera. In 1981, Francesca Woodman died at the age of 22. 90 duotone photos.</p><p>Two of the finest recent monographs on contemporary photographers, these publications use completely different presentations to highlight each artist's work to its best advantage. Jacobson's blurry black-and-white images, which he has described as an "ongoing meditation around desire, loss, and the role of photography as a vehicle for remembrance," offer hazy apparitions, stand-ins for our own lost acquaintances, friends, and lovers. Presented chronologically, the 49 pictures here progress from mostly light, nearly recognizable images of people in familiar settings through fading portraits to almost black, abstract seascapes. The design is minimal, with one exquisitely printed sheet-fed gravure per spread; there is no text, but a short story about a lost love by curator Kertess and a list of plates close the volume. Though she committed suicide in 1981 when she was just 22 years old, Woodman remains influential and her work looks as fresh and startling as that of anyone working today. The daughter of artists, she immersed herself in photography from the time she received her first camera and was recognized early as an exceptional talent. She most frequently used herself or, more precisely, her body as subject, and she produced a wide range of work, from surreal tableaux to story boards to fleeting portraits. These works that above all else seem to convey the imprecision of life are well analyzed in four introductory essays. Next come more than 110 pages of plates drawn from the full decade that she was active, followed by a biography, exhibition history, and bibliography. This is the only work on Woodman in print and by far the most comprehensive ever published; it deserves a place in any serious photography collection. Though perhaps not a definitive study, Jacobson's book presents his work in the best possible light and belongs in collections with an interest in contemporary photography.AEric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Capitalism and Freedom: Fortieth Anniversary Edition</h2><p>Selected by the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> as one of the "hundred most influential books since the war"<br><br>How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat it poses to individual freedom?

Almost within reach of their objective, St. Clair's 1,400 men were attacked by about one thousand Indians. The U.S. force was decimated, suffering nearly one thousand casualties in killed and wounded, while Indian casualties numbered only a few dozen. But despite the lopsided result, it wouldn't appear to carry much significance; it involved only a few thousand people, lasted less than three hours, and the outcome, which was never in doubt, was permanently reversed a mere three years later. Neither an epic struggle nor a clash that changed the course of history, the battle doesn't even have a name. <br><br>Yet, as renowned Native American historian Colin Calloway demonstrates here, St. Clair's Defeat--as it came to be known-- was hugely important for its time. It was both the biggest victory the Native Americans ever won, and, proportionately, the biggest military disaster the United States had suffered. With the British in Canada waiting in the wings for the American experiment in republicanism to fail, and some regions of the West gravitating toward alliance with Spain, the defeat threatened the very existence of the infant United States. Generating a deluge of reports, correspondence, opinions, and debates in the press, it produced the first congressional investigation in American history, while ultimately changing not only the manner in which Americans viewed, raised, organized, and paid for their armies, but the very ways in which they fought their wars. <br><br>Emphasizing the extent to which the battle has been overlooked in history, Calloway illustrates how this moment of great victory by American Indians became an aberration in the national story and a blank spot in the national memory. Calloway shows that St. Clair's army proved no match for the highly motivated and well-led Native American force that shattered not only the American army but the ill-founded assumption that Indians stood no chance against European methods and models of warfare. An engaging and enlightening read for American history enthusiasts and scholars alike, <em>The Victory with</em> <em>No Name</em> brings this significant moment in American history back to light.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin G. Calloway</strong> is Professor of Native American Studies at Dartmouth College. He is the author of many books, including <em>Scratch of a Pen</em> and <em>Pen and Ink Witchcraft</em>.<br><br>"In <em>The Victory With No Name</em>, Colin Calloway recounts the largely forgotten campaign that ensued in crisp, sometimes gripping prose. His account of the intertribal diplomacy and generalship that led the Indians to victory is revelatory."--<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Colin Calloway takes a largely forgotten episode, the rout of green American soldiers by Ohio Indians in 1791, and makes of it something larger and more telling. We see a grappling of two loose collections of peoples--a native coalition struggling to hold onto land and lives, and a hungry young republic in search of its identity. The story of a bloody three hours becomes one of tragedy and ascendance, full of revelations about the nation's emergence."--Elliott West, author of <em>The Last Indian War: The Nez Perce Story</em><p></p><br>"The author ably explains the winner's side of [the 1791 Battle of the Wabash, a largely forgotten clash]--a herculean task since the Native Americans had no written records."--<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"A new spin on the old adage about the winners writing history... Calloway presents keen observations on the link between business interests and the government's land policy that, underpinned by its racial assumptions, made Gen. Arthur St. Clair's 1791 defeat a complex event."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Colin Calloway has written a brilliant and haunting book, one that encourages us to confront entangled ironies fundamental to America's past and present. This battle 'with no name' transformed the course of American nationhood, as a devastating defeat compelled the new nation to yoke its future to conquest of Indians in the West. For Indians, a resounding victory presaged losses that were to come. In one final irony Calloway leaves us with the descendants of these Indians, people who would find an enduring place--even to this day--in the service of American arms."--Patrick Griffin, University of Notre Dame<p></p><br>"Succinct, well-researched and informative..."--<em>The Journal of America's Military Past</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Illustrated Microsoft Office 365 &amp; Excel 2019 Comprehensive (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Now students can master the nuances of Microsoft Office quickly with ILLUSTRATED MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 &amp; EXCEL 2019 COMPREHENSIVE, part of today's popular Illustrated Series.

Over the past five centuries, a rotating cast of kings and conquerors, presidents and dictators have set their sights on the European heartland, desperate to seize this pivotal area or at least prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. From Charles V and Napoleon to Bismarck and Cromwell, from Hitler and Stalin to Roosevelt and Gorbachev, nearly all the key power players of modern history have staked their titanic visions on this vital swath of land. <br><br>In <i>Europe</i>, prizewinning historian Brendan Simms presents an authoritative account of the past half-millennium of European history, demonstrating how the battle for mastery there has shaped the modern world. Beginning in 1453, when the collapse of the Byzantine Empire laid Europe open to Ottoman incursion and prompted the dramatic expansion of the Holy Roman Empire, Simms leads readers through the epic struggle for the heart of Europe. Stretching from the Low Countries through Germany and into the North Italian plain, this relatively compact zone has historically been the richest and most productive on earth. For hundreds of years, its crucial strategic importance stoked a seemingly unending series of conflicts, from the English Civil War to the French Revolution to the appalling world wars of the 20th century. But when Europe is in harmony, Simms shows, the entire world benefits&#x2014;a lesson that current leaders would do well to remember. <br><br>A bold and compelling work by a renowned scholar, <i>Europe</i> integrates religion, politics, military strategy, and international relations to show how history&#x2014;and Western civilization itself&#x2014;was forged in the crucible of Europe.<br><br></p><p><b>Brendan Simms</b> is a fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge and Professor in the History of International Relations at the Center for International Studies, University of Cambridge. The author of five books, including <i>Three Victories and a Defeat</i> and <i>Unfinest Hour</i>, which was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson prize.<br><b><i>The Telegraph</i></b><br>"Brendan Simms is a historian of unusual range and ability.... His new book is nothing less than a history of Europe over the past 550 years.... Writing such a book is a colossally demanding task &#x2014; the sort of challenge most sane historians would baulk at, unless they had a very clear idea of what they wanted to say. Luckily, knowing what he wants to say is one of Simms's strengths. For this book is driven by two great master-ideas, and there is hardly a page in it where their presence is not felt. So, no matter how dense the details may be of kings, wars, treaties and governments, the reader always has the exhilarating sense of moving swiftly onwards.... Like all truly powerful and original works, this is a book worth disagreeing with. But above all it is a book worth reading." <br><br><b><i>The New Statesman</i></b><br>"[An] unrepentantly old-fashioned, lively and erudite history of Europe since 1453.... Ambitious in scope....

His book is also immensely entertaining as well as instructive. There are few pages not enlivened by sharp insight, telling vignette or memorable turn of phrase. In short, this is a great book and everyone interested in European history will want to read it.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Washington Times</i></b><br> [A] sweeping, intelligent and enormously ambitious book.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Paul Kennedy, J. Richardson Dilworth Professor of History, Yale University, and author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i></b><br> <i>Europe</i> is a superb, sure-footed analysis of how this center of world civilization, technology, and warfare evolved since the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is unabashedly political history, and the better for being so. Simms's acumen and sharp opinions are a joy to read. This book will be appreciated both by the general reader and by history teachers everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> Prodigious.... If postmodern scholarship has Ranke spinning in his grave, Mr. Simms's book will give his weary soul some rest.... This is the history of Richelieu, Metternich and Kissinger, not of Luther, Newton and Beethoven. Such a summary may sound arid, but <i>Europe</i> is anything but. In fact, it draws the reader forward with its grand epic of shifting alliances, clashing armies and ambitious statecraft. Simms is a skilled writer with a rare gift for compressed analysis. His focus on the military and diplomatic arc of European history lends his book a strong narrative line and thematic coherence. Patterns emerge that might have remained buried in a more various survey.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>The Economist</b></i><br> Brendan Simms's new history [is] especially timely. He has, in effect, dropped a big stone into the European pond and stood back to watch the ripples spread.... It is a compelling and provocative thesis.... This is sweeping history, told with verve and panache, and it is all the more refreshing for that.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Financial Times</b></i><br> <i>Europe</i> is a stimulating, impressive history that starts with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and extends to the present day....

This story of their little-known missionary efforts in Belize from 1898 to 2008 builds upon their already distinguished work, through the Archdiocese of New Orleans, of teaching slaves and free people of color, caring for orphans and the elderly, and tending to the poor and needy. Utilizing previously unpublished archival documents along with extensive personal correspondence and interviews, Edward T. Brett has produced a fascinating account of the 110-year mission of the Sisters of the Holy Family to the Garifuna people of Belize. Brett discusses the foundation and growth of the struggling order in New Orleans up to the sisters' decision in 1898 to accept a teaching commitment in the Stann Creek District of what was then British Honduras. The early history of the British Honduras mission concentrates especially on Mother Austin Jones, the superior responsible for expanding the order's work into the mission field. In examining the Belizean mission from the eve of the Second Vatican Council through the post&#x2013;Vatican II years, Brett sensitively chronicles the sisters' efforts to conform to the spirit of the council and describes the creative innovations that the Holy Family community introduced into the Belizean educational system. In the final chapter he looks at the congregation's efforts to sustain its missionary work in the face of the shortage of new religious vocations. Brett&#x2019;s study is more than just a chronicle of the Holy Family Sisters' accomplishments in Belize. He treats the issues of racism and gender discrimination that the African American congregation encountered both within the church and in society, demonstrating how the sisters survived and even thrived by learning how to skillfully negotiate with the white, dominant power structure.</p><p>Edward T. Brett is professor of history at La Roche College.&#x201c;Extensive interviews with and letters from the nuns authenticate the humanity in the Belize mission story.

This is, in short, an important contribution to Catholic history that establishes the crucial role played by an African-descendent congregation in mission history.&#x201d; (The Catholic Historical Review)<br><br>&#x201c;This short, informative text tells the little-known story of the foreign missionary efforts of one of the two oldest Catholic orders for African American women in the US, the New Orleans-based Sisters of the Holy Family.&#x201d; (Choice)<br><br>&#x201c;The Holy Family Sisters made a large contribution to the education of women in the Belizean mission, and work with the poor eventually drew the sisters back to their original charism.

Utilizing previously ignored archival documents as well as a substantial body of personal correspondence and interviews conducted with a broad, balanced spectrum of informants, he has produced a lucid study of an African American sisterhood&#x2019;s evolving concept of mission during a century of service. The racial component of his work makes it especially compelling in that he analyzes in nuanced fashion how the common African descent of both the missionaries and their target population simultaneously facilitated and complicated their interactions. Scholarly works examining African American women religious remain exceedingly rare. This book adds to this worthwhile but extremely underserved area a unique focus on their missionary activities."

The ways of telling about the very first Christmas are as many and as varied as the stars in the sky. And so it was for Langston Hughes, who recounted those long-ago events in six different ways -- in live poems he wrote and in one he translated from the Spanish. <br> In this memorable book, these six poems are simply and movingly illustrated by Ashley Bryan. That Christmas is for everyone -- young and old, black and white, rich and poor -- has never been more clearly shown. Though African American children -- and adults -- will find the book a special one for them, everyone who takes time to enjoy the book will come away with a new understanding of the holiday. <br> Ashley Bryan has long been known for his interest in and illustration of African American spirituals and poetry. Here he puts his gifts of illustration to work in a way that seems to reflect his dedication to both.</p><p>Award-winning illustrator Ashley Bryan noticed that Langston Hughes had written five short children's poems about Christmas--and had translated a sixth "from a Puerto Rican Christmas card." Here Bryan collects and illustrates all six in a beautiful book that will bring out the meaning of the season for African American and other children alike. Bryan has a superb--and characteristically African--color sense, using a saturated palette of ochre, chocolate, russet, and yellow-orange, with a counterpoint of bright blues and greens. The pictures of parents, children, and kneeling Magi are an appropriately vivid, joyful evocation of Hughes's simple cadences: "Three Wise Men / One dark like me / Part of His / Nativity." "They did not travel in an airplane / They did not travel by car / They did not travel on a streamline train / They traveled on foot from afar / They traveled on foot from afar." (Ages 3 to 7) <i>--Richard Farr</i>Langston Hughes (1902&#x2013;1967) was born in Joplin, Missouri, and lived much of his life in Harlem, New York. As one America&#x2019;s most cherished chroniclers of the black experience, known for his work during the Harlem Renaissance, Hughes&#x2019;s work was constantly groundbreaking throughout his forty-six-year career. His poetry about the ocean and the symbolism that surrounds it stems from his travels through Africa and Europe working as a seaman.<br><br>Ashley Bryan grew up to the sound of his mother singing from morning to night, and he has shared the joy of song with children ever since. A beloved illustrator, he was recently named a Newbery Honoree for his picture book,&nbsp;<i>Freedom Over Me</i>.

Is the debate over fossil fuels highly partisan and ideological? Does public opinion about fossil fuels and alternative energies divide along the fault between red states and blue states? And how much do concerns about climate change weigh on their opinions? In Cheap and Clean, Stephen Ansolabehere and David Konisky show that Americans are more pragmatic than ideological in their opinions about energy alternatives, more unified than divided about their main concerns, and more local than global in their approach to energy.</p><p>Drawing on extensive surveys they designed and conducted over the course of a decade (in conjunction with MIT's Energy Initiative), Ansolabehere and Konisky report that beliefs about the costs and environmental harms associated with particular fuels drive public opinions about energy. People approach energy choices as consumers, and what is most important to them is simply that energy be cheap and clean. Most of us want energy at low economic cost and with little social cost (that is, minimal health risk from pollution). The authors also find that although environmental concerns weigh heavily in people's energy preferences, these concerns are local and not global. Worries about global warming are less pressing to most than worries about their own city's smog and toxic waste. With this in mind, Ansolabehere and Konisky argue for policies that target both local pollutants and carbon emissions (the main source of global warming). The local and immediate nature of people's energy concerns can be the starting point for a new approach to energy and climate change policy.</p></p><p>Stephen Ansolabehere is Professor of Government at Harvard University and coauthor of <i>The End of Inequality</i> and other books.<p>Ansolabehere and Konisky point out that the attitudes of the American public to energy technologies ultimately will determine our energy future. They give the reader a fascinating report: the public's preferences are based on perceived costs and harms. These choices have been remarkably stable over time and not predictable by the popular variables of gender or party except on the vital issue of climate change. The public seems to be better informed than our political leaders about our energy future.</p>&#x2015;<b>John Deutch</b>, Institute Professor, MIT; former Director of Energy Research, Undersecretary of Energy, U.S. Department of Energy<br><br><p>If you are concerned about climate change, energy, or the environment, you should read <i>Cheap and Clean</i>. It is the most thought-provoking book on energy I have read in years. Ansolabehere and Konisky are lucid writers, their arguments are persuasive and their message is surprisingly hopeful. Researchers will be challenged by their approach, and policy makers can find considerable wisdom here.</p>&#x2015;<b>Thomas Dietz</b>, Professor and Founding Director, Environmental Science and Policy Program, Michigan State University<br><br><p><i>Cheap and Clean</i> is the most important book yet written on how Americans think about energy issues.

Yet by the 1930s, after the radio and the Talkies were regular features of American life, Lee de Forest had seemingly lost everything. Why? Why didn&#x2019;t he receive the recognition and acclaim he sought his entire life until years later in 1959, when he was awarded an Oscar?</p><p>A lifelong innovator, Lee de Forest invented the three-element vacuum tube which he developed between 1906 and 1916 as a detector, amplifier, and oscillator of radio waves. As early as 1907, he was broadcasting music programming. In 1918, he began to develop a system for recording and playing back sound by using light patterns on motion picture film. In order to promote and demonstrate his process he made hundreds of short sound films, found theatres for their showing, and issued publicity to gain audiences for his invention. While he received many patents for this technology, he was ignored by the film industry.</p><p><i>Lee de Forest, King of Radio, Television, and Film</i> is about the process of invention&#x2015;how inventors really get ideas and how every inventor learns that they must know the work of those who came before, and why the myth of the lone inventor and the &#x201c;Aha! moment&#x201d; is largely a fiction.</p><p>Through his inventions, Lee de Forest made possible the mass entertainment media we enjoy today.

The modern food economy is a paradox. Surplus &#39;food mountains&#39; sit alongside global malnutrition and the developed world subsidizes its own agriculture while pressurizing the developing world to liberalize at all costs. Export competition is increasingly aggressive whilst the reliance on imports in many countries has worrying implications for food security. Family farms go out of business and dispossessed peasant farmers are driven into urban slums. The WTO&#39;s uneven application of neoliberal economics to food production is relatively new, and the consequences of mounting deficits, rising &#39;food miles&#39;, and social upheaval, are untested but ominous.</p><p><b>Tony Weis</b> is associate professor in geography at the University of Western Ontario.

The dualism that emerged in Cuban ideology--between liberal constructs of patria and radical formulations of nationality--is fully investigated as a source of both national tension and competing notions of liberty, equality, and justice. P�rez integrates local and provincial developments with issues of class, race, and gender to give readers a full and fascinating account of Cuba's history, focusing on its struggle for nationality. <br> This third edition features the latest research on Cuba, including a new chapter on post-Cold War Cuba that covers the years 1995 through 2004.

Beginning with the "discovery" of that art by European artists and writers early in the twentieth century, this anthology charts the evolving pictorial responses, artistic aspirations, aesthetic theories, and cultural debates that have developed from this encounter. Written by artists, literary figures, collectors, museum curators, and cultural critics, these essays&#x2015;most of them never before translated or reprinted&#x2015;show the dazzling range of issues elicited by the confrontation with primitive arts and cultures. <br><br>Primitivism designates not a specific movement or group of artists, but a persuasive notion crucial to twentieth-century art and modern thinking generally. Because the encounter between the West and primitive art took place at the height of Western colonialism, a number of racial and political issues come into play, either overtly or implicitly, in writings about both the art and the people who produced it. The contributions to this volume speak to each other in provocative ways, giving a unique overview of those issues. <br><br>Jack Flam provides an introduction to the book and brief outlines for each of its four sections. Also included are a coda of quotations from artists and critics from throughout the century; a chronology of events, exhibitions, and publications; an extensive bibliography; and over forty illustrations.</p><p>"This is a much needed, important collection-a goldmine of sources for scholars and students. The texts articulate the key Primitivist aesthetic discourses of the period, offering crucial insight into the complex and always changing nexus between culture, politics, and representation. Because of the breadth of the materials covered and the controversies they raise, this anthology is one of the all too rare volumes that not only will provide reference materials for years to come but also will feature centrally in classroom discussions."&#x2015;Suzanne Preston Blier, author of <i>African Vodun: Art, Psychology, and Power</i><br><br>"For almost a century art historians have fretted about the notion of primitivism in the arts. This comprehensive-in both senses of the word-anthology is a peerless source of the history of responses to works categorized as 'primitive.' In its range, the book touches upon all the troubling questions-formal, anthropological, political, historical-that have bedeviled the study of the arts of Oceania, Africa, and North and South America, and provides the grounds, at last, for intelligent pursuit of keener distinctions. I regard this book as a superb contribution to the study of Modern art; in fact, indispensable."&#x2015;Dore Ashton, author of <i>Noguchi East and West</i><br><br>"An extraordinarily useful and complete collection of primary documents, many translated for the first time into English, and almost all unlikely to be encountered elsewhere without serious effort. Its five sections, each with a lively and scholarly introduction, reveal the diverse views of artists and writers on primitive art from Matisse, Picasso, and Fry to many far less known and sometimes surprising figures. The book also uncovers the politics and aesthetics of the major museum exhibitions that gained acceptance for art that had been both reviled and mythologized. Recent texts included are all germane. This book will be invaluable for any college course on the topic."&#x2015;Shelly Errington, author of <i>The Death of Authentic Primitive Art and Other Tales of Progress</i><br><br>"An exceptionally valuable anthology of seventy documents--most heretofore unavailable in English--on the ongoing controversies surrounding Primitivism and Modern art. Insightfully chosen and annotated, the collection is brilliantly introduced by Jack Flam's essay on the historical progression, contexts, and cultural complexities of more than one hundred years' ideas about Primitivism.

Ordered by theme, the book covers such topics as schools in Victorian England, domestic entertainment, the introduction of the railroad, and the poor conditions in prisons and workhouses, which loom large in Dickens&#x2019;s novels&#x2014;and, indeed, his own childhood. Dickens was also an avid theater enthusiast who arranged productions and public readings of many of his works, and this book explores his role throughout his later years in adroitly adapting his novels for the stage. <br><i><br>The Curious World of Dickens</i> breathes new life on this momentous occasion into the vibrant world inhabited by Dickens and his characters.<br></p><p><b>Clive Hurst</b> is head of rare books at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.

He rushed with outstretched hands to seize her, but clutched only air. Night Shivers presents a treasure trove of the stories of Mrs J. H. Riddell, one of the greatest Victorian writers of ghost stories. These tales, many of which have been out of print for years, take the reader on fearful journeys into the gloomy haunts of old neglected houses, into a world of prophetic dreams, out onto the wild terrain of Ireland to encounter a frightful banshee and even down into Hell itself. In these fourteen short stories and one novella, The Uninhabited House, there is the distillation of the best and most effective of Riddell s spine-tingling supernatural fiction.</p><p>An internationally recognized expert on Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle, David Stuart Davies is the editor of the crime fiction magazine "Sherlock" and the author of several books on Sherlock Holmes.

But in Africa praising is ubiquitous, a cultural institution cutting across ethnic differences, and expressing a profound humanism grounded in inter-relationships. All the poems in this book were originally &#34;performances&#34;. Some praises are of individuals, others are more concerned with the family or clan. Plants and animals, even bicycles and trains are also addressed. Many praises are lively descriptions intended to elicit from the subject some service to the human community. By paying close attention to the way these praises present themselves as poetry on the printed page (rendering their imagery and rhythms as precisely as possible in English while retaining their African idiom), and by annotating the poems to make their cultural references intelligible, Dr Judith Gleason has brought traditional Africa into focus for the general reader, to whom the continent remains all too dark and hazy. There is African humour in action, there is the delicacy with which African poets have traditionally perceived the things of this world, there is the respect these poets feel for themselves and for others there are the hopes and despairs all people live through on whatever continent.</p><p></p><h2>The Preacher's Outline &amp; Sermon Bible: Thessalonians - Philemon: New International Version (The Preacher's Outline &amp; Sermon Bible NIV)</h2><p>What if you could study 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians, 1 &amp; 2 Timothy, Titus and Philemon with your favorite Bible scholars from across the ages?

The second half is designed to enhance creativity and intuition through exercises.</p><p></p><h2>The Individual and the Political Order: An Introduction to Social and Political Philosophy</h2><p>This fourth edition of The Individual and the Political Order provides a careful, accessible, and reasoned liberal justification for the democratic state and political authority. The central feature of liberalism is the commitment to individual autonomy. The authors show how that commitment provides a defense of democracy, and they give a liberal interpretation to such core values as liberty, equality, and political authority. Although the authors support liberal theory, they also provide a sympathetic treatment of the critics of liberalism. The authors give a sound explanation of such positions as feminist political theory, communitarianism, and post-modernism but they also argue persuasively that these theories fall short as adequate theories of the political order. A significant feature of the new edition is the treatment of international issues and globalization, particularly the war on terrorism and poverty in the third world. This edition retains its balanced treatment of such major theorists as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Rawls and, in this edition, Marx. This edition continues the tradition of readability, balance, and careful argumentation that characterized the earlier editions. The Individual and the Political Order is accessible to a wide audience and to nearly all individuals who are interested in how citizens in a state should be governed.</p><p>Norman E.

Rassendyl masquerades as the king in order to save the country from a treacherous plot and secures the release of the wronged prisoner. In the process he wins the heart of the beautiful princess Flavia, but ultimately surrenders the crown and the hand of his beloved princess to the rightful ruler.</p><p>Rupert of Hentzau, which ends in tragedy rather than triumph, is the darker, more problematic sequel to The Prisoner of Zenda. Full of swash-buckling feats of heroism as well as witty irony, these adventure tales are also wonderfully executed satires on late nineteenth-century European politics.</p></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Anthony Hope&#39;s swashbuckling romance transports his English gentleman hero, Rudolf Rassendyll, from a comfortable life in London to fast-moving adventures in Ruritania, a mythical land steeped in political intrigue. Rassendyll bears a striking resemblance to Rudolf Elphberg who is about to be crowned King of Ruritania. When the rival to the throne, Black Michael of Strelsau, attempts to seize power by imprisoning Elphberg in the Castle of Zenda, Rassendyll is obliged to impersonate the King to uphold the rightful sovereignty and ensure political stability. Rassendyll endures a trial of strength in his encounters with the notorious Rupert of Hentzau, and a test of a different sort as he grows to love the Princess Flavia. Five times filmed, The Prisoner of Zenda has been deservedly popular as a classic of romance and adventure since its publication in 1894.</p><h2>Numerical Methods: Design, Analysis, and Computer Implementation of Algorithms</h2><p><p><i>Numerical Methods</i> provides a clear and concise exploration of standard numerical analysis topics, as well as nontraditional ones, including mathematical modeling, Monte Carlo methods, Markov chains, and fractals.

Ross</h2><p>This Supplement is intended to provide a diverse and extensive range of additional practice material for use in mastering the grammatical content of Introducing Biblical Hebrew by Allen P. Ross (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001). It is based upon the writing system, vocabulary, morphology and syntax of Biblical Hebrew as these are presented in Introducing Biblical Hebrew, running parallel to the first 41 chapters of that volume. Chapters 1-6 deal progressively with the introductory issues of writing and pronouncing Hebrew, with practice based upon Genesis 1-2. Three types of exercise accompany the study of vocabulary, morphology and syntax: parsing of isolated forms, with emphasis upon the verb (chapters 10-41); two sections of sentences composed in Hebrew, the first focussed upon the material of the current chapter and the second containing longer sentences drawn from all the material encountered up to that point (chapters 3-41, with isolated phrases initially); and three sections of passages drawn directly from the Hebrew Bible (chapters 9-41) - isolated verses containing salient features of the grammar studied at that point, longer prose passages (Gen 1:1-2:4, 22:1-19, Deut 8-11, Ruth 1-4, Gen 37:12-36), and short poetic passages from the Psalms (Ps 1, 121, 133, 100, 103, 19, 113, 27, 91, 34, 8). Unfamiliar forms and syntax in the OT passages are footnoted, making it possible to read them without recourse to additional language tools. <br> <br> David M.

Eminent French historian Robert Mantran has written of Lewis's work: "How could one resist being attracted to the books of an author who opens for you the doors of an unknown or misunderstood universe, who leads you within to its innermost domains: religion, ways of thinking, conceptions of power, culture--an author who upsets notions too often fixed, fallacious, or partisan." <br> In <em>Islam and the West</em>, Bernard Lewis brings together in one volume eleven essays that indeed open doors to the innermost domains of Islam. Lewis ranges far and wide in these essays. He includes long pieces, such as his capsule history of the interaction--in war and peace, in commerce and culture--between Europe and its Islamic neighbors, and shorter ones, such as his deft study of the Arabic word <em>watan</em> and what its linguistic history reveals about the introduction of the idea of patriotism from the West. Lewis offers a revealing look at Edward Gibbon's portrait of Muhammad in <em>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> (unlike previous writers, Gibbon saw the rise of Islam not as something separate and isolated, nor as a regrettable aberration from the onward march of the church, but simply as a part of human history); he offers a devastating critique of Edward Said's controversial book, <em>Orientalism</em>; and he gives an account of the impediments to translating from classic Arabic to other languages (the old dictionaries, for one, are packed with scribal errors, misreadings, false analogies, and etymological deductions that pay little attention to the evolution of the language). And he concludes with an astute commentary on the Islamic world today, examining revivalism, fundamentalism, the role of the Shi'a, and the larger question of religious co-existence between Muslims, Christians, and Jews. <br> A matchless guide to the background of Middle East conflicts today, <em>Islam and the West</em> presents the seasoned reflections of an eminent authority on one of the most intriguing and little understood regions in the world.<br></p><p>In Islam and the West, Bernard Lewis brings together in one volume eleven essays that indeed open doors to the innermost domains of Islam.<br><strong>Bernard Lewis</strong> is the Cleveland E.

Wodehouse documented the lives of the inimitable Jeeves and Wooster for nearly sixty years. These two were the most popular creations of a novelist widely proclaimed to be the finest comic English writer by critics and fans alike.</p><p>SEBASTIAN FAULKS's books include the bestsellers <i>A Possible Life, A Week in December, Human Traces, On Green Dolphin Street, Charlotte Gray </i>and <i>Birdsong.</i> In his acclaimed 2011 book <i>Faulks on Fiction </i>which accompanied his series for BBC Two, Sebastian Faulks wrote, "If I were to be quite honest, I suppose I would have to admit that a scene in <i>The Mating Season</i> is probably my favourite in the whole canon of English literature." As a lifelong fan of P.G. Wodehouse, he was delighted to be asked by the Wodehouse Estate to write a new novel using the immortal characters of Jeeves and Wooster. <br><br>P.G. WODEHOUSE wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler's Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded The Mark Twain Medal for 'having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world'. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine's Day.*Starred Review* What, ho?! This blighter Faulks, after making a reasonably good show of posing as Ian Fleming (Devil May Care, 2009), has the unmitigated gall to take a run at impersonating the inimitable P. G., the very incarnation of sui generis? Doesn&#x2019;t he know that Wodehouseans far and wide, well born and less so, will be sharpening their incisors for the chance to take a chomp at the hindquarters of the cheeky upstart? But wait. Hold off, old sports. Young Faulksie just may have the gray matter to make a go of it. The first order of business when attempting to offer homage to Sir Pelham Grenville is to construct a plot as screwball crazy as anything Shakespeare ever concocted in the Forest of Arden (disguises, mistaken identities, catastrophic kerfuffles all de rigueur); next is to plop bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster in the middle of the muddle; and, finally, of course, it&#x2019;s necessary to set Bertie&#x2019;s unflappable manservant, the all-knowing Jeeves, to the herculean task of making it all work. Faulksie&#x2019;s plot is spot on: Bertie&#x2019;s pal, Peregrine Woody Beeching, has been dumped by his beloved, but Bertie is on the case. The plan, for reasons only a savvy Hegelian could fathom, involves Bertie posing as a manservant and Jeeves as his master. Brilliant stroke, that, allowing Jeeves to show his stuff at dinner-table chitchat and Bertie to, well, spill the gravy. Naturally, it all takes place at a country house (Wodehouse&#x2019;s Forest of Arden), and, equally naturally, Miss Georgiana Meadowes, who makes Bertie&#x2019;s heart go pitty-pat, is also in attendance. OK, fine, this P. G. poseur gets the plot right, but what about the all-important patter, the Bertie-isms and the priceless Bertie-Jeeves dialogue duets? But Faulksie nails it again, evoking rather than imitating, but doing so in perfect pitch. Finally, old-timers will doubtless recoil in horror at the shocking conclusion, but let&#x2019;s all loosen our stuffed shirts and let the new guy have his way. Top drawer.

Mr. Sund's few published volumes of poetry and frequent public readings established his reputation as one of the most distinctive poetic voices of the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoyed a tremendous popularity before his death in 2001. His short, imagistic poems, in the tradition of William Carlos Williams and Kenneth Rexroth, distill the essence of the Northwest landscape and in plain speech celebrate themes of family, friendship, work and quiet contemplation.<br> Included here are the poet's award-winning collections, Bunch Grass, which gave literary voice to the rolling wheat country east of the Cascade Mountains in his native Washington State, and Ish River, which celebrated the misty, riverine landscape of the Puget Sound country, a place, in the poet's words, "between two mountain ranges where / many rivers / run down to an inland sea". But the great bulk of this collection contains poems unpublished during the poet&#x2019;s lifetime or published only in very limited editions. There is also a generous selection of his translations, from Issa, Buson, Basho, and most especially from the Swedish poet Rabbe Enckell, with whom Mr. Sund felt a close affinity.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Loser</h2><p>Thomas Bernhard was one of the most original writers of the twentieth century. His formal innovation ranks with Beckett and Kafka, his outrageously cantankerous voice recalls Dostoevsky, but his gift for lacerating, lyrical, provocative prose is incomparably his own.<br><br>One of Bernhard's most acclaimed novels, <i>The Loser</i> centers on a fictional relationship between piano virtuoso Glenn Gould and two of his fellow students who feel compelled to renounce their musical ambitions in the face of Gould's incomparable genius. One commits suicide, while the other-- the obsessive, witty, and self-mocking narrator-- has retreated into obscurity. Written as a monologue in one remarkable unbroken paragraph, <i>The Loser </i>is a brilliant meditation on success, failure, genius, and fame.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>For music lovers, perfectionists, and estheticians, Thomas Bernhard's <i>The Loser</i> (1983) poses an irresistible drama of failed excellence. In 1953 three friends, among whom is the famed Glenn Gould, study with Horowitz. Rarely sleeping, hardly eating, they burn intensely with the white and ruthless flame of virtuosity. Only Gould ascends. But this is no conventional narrative--neat, action-driven, or linear. It opens with the specter of death--Gould's at 51, and a suicide. Art exalts even as it destroys, when the aspirant is found wanting. Both Wertheimer, the suicide, and the narrator turn their backs on their musical careers, thus triggering their process of "deterioration." What is the consequence of throwing it all away? And yet, what are the rewards of realized genius? After Gould becomes, indeed, <i>Glenn Gould</i>, the two friends go to visit him in Canada. "He had barricaded himself in his house. For life. All our lives the three of us have shared the desire to barricade ourselves from the world. All three of us were born barricade fanatics."<p> Bernhard fans will recognize the restrained rant, the execution of an idea carried to a logical, caustic extreme. The rant creates, of the novel, a grand philosophical speculation: What is devotion to one's art? What is it to truly understand one's art and to not misuse one's gift? And, alas, <i>The Loser</i> can also be read as the profound consequence of perfectionism, whereby all efforts to create or execute anything of note are squashed in the critical mind's ruthless self-scrutiny. The narrator works, for example, on his Glenn Gould essay for nine years, grateful, in the end, that he has published nothing. "How good it is that none of these imperfect, incomplete works has ever appeared, I thought, had I published them.... [T]oday I would be the unhappiest person imaginable, confronted daily with disastrous works crying out with errors, imprecision, carelessness, amateurishness." The one regenerative act seems to be that of self-destruction. Destruction, indeed, becomes the flip side of perfectionist rigor. Thomas Bernhard (1931-89) was his own unique genius and in <i>The Loser</i>, one of his most acclaimed novels, he creates a chilling portrait of tragic compulsion, teasing and testing our assumptions human behavior. --<i>Hollis Giamatteo</i></p>A brilliant account of an imagined relationship among three men- including the late piano virtuoso Glenn Gould- who meet in 1953 to study with Vladimir Horowitz.</p><h2>Baseball: Four Decades of Sports Illustrated&#39;s Finest Writing on America&#39;s Favorite Pastime (Sports Illustrated Collectors Library)</h2><p>A Sports Illustrated tribute to America&#39;s pastime features the magazine&#39;s best stories on the game by Robert Creamer, Frank Deford, Peter Gammons, Steve Wulf, George Plimpton, William Nack, Red Smith, and other great sportswriters.</p><p></p><h2>Lost (Fearless, No. 25)</h2><p>Now that things are insane again, they&#39;re finally back to normal.

I could hardly put it down....A story of triumph over adversity."&#x2014;James McPherson</b><br><br>Award-winning historian Martha Hodes brings us into the extraordinary world of Eunice Connolly. Born white and poor in New England, Eunice moved from countryside to factory city, worked in the mills, then followed her husband to the Deep South. When the Civil War came, Eunice's brothers joined the Union army while her husband fought and died for the Confederacy. Back in New England, a widow and the mother of two, Eunice barely got by as a washerwoman, struggling with crushing depression. Four years later, she fell in love with a black sea captain, married him, and moved to his home in the West Indies. Following every lead in a collection of 500 family letters, Hodes traced Eunice's footsteps and met descendants along the way. This story of misfortune and defiance takes up grand themes of American history&#x2014;opportunity and racism, war and freedom&#x2014;and illuminates the lives of ordinary people in the past. 47 illustrations.</p><p><b>Martha Hodes</b>, professor of history at New York University, won the Allan Nevins Prize for <i>White Women, Black Men: Illicit Sex in the Nineteenth-Century South</i>. She lives in New York City and Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.Hodes reconstructs the intriguing and unusual life of Eunice Richardson Stone Connolly. a mill laborer in mid&#x2013;19th-century New England who went South with her husband to seek their fortune; homesick, even as her husband fought for the Confederacy, she returned to New Hampshire, where she was reduced to working as a washerwoman. The only thing that brought an impoverished Eunice respectability was her white skin. But then she heard of her husband's death, and in 1869, mystifying some of her relatives, Connolly put that respectability at risk, too, marrying a well-to-do black sea captain from Grand Cayman Island and moving there with him. Hodes, a historian at NYU (<i>White Women, Black Men: Illicit Sex in the Nineteenth-Century South</i>), relies on a rich cache of Connolly's letters, which are housed at Duke University. Unfortunately, the letters don't reveal how Connolly met her second husband or explain in depth why she decided to marry him. Hodes's prose, though sometimes a bit affected ("In place of fiction, I offer the craft of history, assisted by the art of speculation"), is lucid and her account is engaging, though for readers steeped in the subject not pathbreaking; what Hodes has to tell us about the 19th century&#x2014;that race was socially constructed and complicated, for example&#x2014;is nothing new. 47 b&amp;w illus., 2 maps. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Men whose ideas and influences are surveyed include expressionists and futurists, Buckminster Fuller, members of the Bauhaus, Hans Hollein and Walter Pichler, Kenzo Tange and the Metabolists, as well as engineers, inventors, stylists, town planners, shipbuilders, academicians, and philosophers. Most of the experimentalists discussed have done some work in the area of conventional building; they have, at any rate, a heritage, firmly rooted in what Peter Cook describes as the basic discipline of the twentieth century-a heritage that can be broadly divided into expressionism, rationalism, modernism, and politicism. After discussing modern experimental work in its historical context, Mr Cook evaluates the ethical context of experiment and delineates various current &#39;orthodoxies&#39;-organic, methodic, opportunistic, scientific, utopian, and tasteful-to which architects may find themselves subscribing. And since, within the highly developed international network, there are still highly identifiable national pockets of experiment, he describes in detail the most interesting of these-current developments in Austria, Japan, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, and England.</p><p></p><h2>Even Now (Lost Love Series #1)</h2><p>Sometimes hope for the future is found in the ashes of yesterday.Shane Galanter---a man ready to put down roots after years of searching.

A perfect example of the tone of the collection is the opening tale, a jolly mystery that culminates in Batman throwing his old chum Superman a birthday party. For all of the hokey word balloons that spell out Superman's choked-back sobs of anguish at whatever bizarre circumstance he finds himself in, and despite Lois Lane's constant bold proclamations of her intent to marry the Man of Steel, the pages contain a massive catalogue of invention. Many of the stories consist of Superman's clever ways of convincing Lois that he's not Clark Kent, or persuading some criminal that he's now immune to kryptonite. The text is fraught with barefaced exposition, but the tricks, traps, puzzles, and quandaries that Superman constantly outsmarts are charming and should give readers a clear indication of what comics were like in an earlier age and how they captured the imaginations of young readers so well and so completely. The stories also provide a happy sampling of the first appearances of a number of Superman's notable supporting characters and beloved minutiae.<i>&#x2013;Benjamin Russell, The Derryfield School, Manchester, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Robert Rayevsky lives in Parksville, New York, with his wife, kids, cats, and a dachshund. <br>Grade 1-4-- Aided by a silver fife and a perfect peach, the youngest son of a poor widow outwits a greedy king and wins the hand of the princess. Although this retelling is based upon a French folktale, variants exist in other cultures, such as the Norwegian "The King's Hares," found in Stith Thompson's One Hundred Favorite Folktales (Indiana Univ. Pr, 1968). Kimmel has adapted Paul Delarue's "The Three May Peaches," from the Borzoi Book of French Folk Tales (Ayer, 1980), strengthening the central conflict by making the king more villainous but weakening its impact by removing the earthy humor. In Delarue's version, the young man tricks the king into kissing a donkey's behind. Rayevsky's accompanying illustrations use several mediums: at times pastel pencil on a colored charcoal drawing paper, other times colored ink washes on white paper with Chinese white highlights. As in the past, the artist's pictures employ stylized, elongated figures but here the exaggeration of human features becomes almost grotesque, and the depiction of a half-skinned rabbit, while supported by the story, may strike some readers as gratuitous.

The system had been in operation almost unchanged since the eighteenth-century. It was a female rite of passage, an elaborate initiation ceremony marking the emergence of the virgin out of the schoolroom and into society at the marriageable age of seventeen. But that year, in 1958, it was drawing to a close. Under pressure to shine - not least from their mothers - the girls were somewhere between teenagers and clones of the Queen herself. Still the focus for newspaper diarists and society photographers, these young women participated in a party season stretching for months among the great houses of London and the Home Counties.

In the midst of a tough Senate campaign against an incumbent Democrat, the young Republican hoped Reagan&#x2019;s endorsement would give a much-needed boost to his insurgent campaign. He even had a camera crew ready to capture the president&#x2019;s words for a TV commercial he planned to air during the campaign&#x2019;s final stretch. Alas, when Reagan finally stepped to the microphone, he smiled for the crowd and declared: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy to be here with my good friend, Mitch O&#x2019;Donnell.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> That was hardly Mitch McConnell&#x2019;s first setback, and far from his last. He swallowed hard, put his head down, and kept going. Four weeks later, in the biggest upset of the year, his dream of being a US senator came true&#x2014;by a margin of about one vote per precinct. By persevering, he&#x2019;d be the only Republican in the country to beat an incumbent Democratic US senator.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> McConnell learned patience and fortitude during his post&#x2013;World War II youth in Alabama. His mother helped him beat polio by leading him through long, aching exer�cises every day for two years. His father taught him the importance of standing up to bullies, even if it meant tak�ing the occasional punch. It turned out to be the perfect childhood for a future Senate majority leader. &#x201c;In the line of work I would choose, compromise is key, but I&#x2019;d come to find that certain times required me to invoke the fight�ing spirit both of my parents instilled in me.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> For more than three decades, McConnell has worked steadily to advance conservative values, including limited government, indi�vidual liberty, fiscal prudence, and a strong national defense. But he has always cared much more about moving the ball forward than about who gets the credit.<br><br> Now McConnell reveals what he really thinks about the rivalry between the Senate and the House; the players and the stakes involved when a group of political oppor�tunists tried to hijack the Tea Party movement; and key figures such as Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Harry Reid. He explains the real causes of the chronic gridlock that has so many vot�ers enraged, his ongoing efforts to restore the US Senate&#x2019;s indispensable dual role as a brake on excess and a tool for national consensus, and what ordinary citizens have a right to expect from Washington.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><p><b>MITCH McCONNELL</b> has represented Kentucky in the US Senate since January 1985 and has served as Senate majority leader since January 2015.

Back in print after eight years, Testament--a chilling novel of a race for survival against a fanatical white supremacy group--is newly repackaged to kick off Warner&#39;s much-in-demand Morrell backlist program.</p><p>My father was killed during World War II, shortly after I was born in 1943. My mother had difficulty raising me and at the same time holding a job, so she put me in an orphanage and later in a series of boarding homes. I grew up unsure of who I was, desperately in need of a father figure. Books and movies were my escape. Eventually I decided to be a writer and sought help from two men who became metaphorical fathers to me: Stirling Silliphant, the head writer for the classic TV series &#34;Route 66&#34; about two young men in a Corvette who travel America in search of themselves, and Philip Klass (whose pen name is William Tenn), a novelist who taught at the Pennsylvania State University where I went to graduate school from 1966 to 1970. The result of their influence is my 1972 novel, First Blood, which introduced Rambo. The search for a father is prominent in that book, as it is in later ones, most notably The Brotherhood of the Rose (1984), a thriller about orphans and spies. During this period, I was a professor of American literature at the University of Iowa. With two professions, I worked seven days a week until exhaustion forced me to make a painful choice and resign from the university in 1986. One year later, my fifteen-year-old son, Matthew, died from bone cancer, and thereafter my fiction tended to depict the search for a son, particularly in Fireflies (1988) and Desperate Measures (1994). To make a new start, my wife and I moved to the mountains and mystical light of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where my work changed yet again, exploring the passionate relationships between men and women, highlighting them against a background of action as in the newest, Burnt Sienna. To give his stories a realistic edge, he has been trained in wilderness survival, hostage negotiation, executive protection, antiterrorist driving, assuming identities, electronic surveillance, and weapons. A former professor of American literature at the University of Iowa, Morrell now lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><h2>Pictorial History of the Jewish People</h2><p>Pictorial History of the Jewish People</p><p></p><h2>The Coast Mappers</h2><p>In the mid-nineteenth century, little was known of the west coast and waterways. The ships that sailed those waters did so at a considerable risk, sometimes depending on only a school atlas to navigate and all too often crashing into the rocks. So the U.S. Coast Survey, whose purpose was to map every mile of American shoreline, commissioned George Davidson to chart all of the major points on the coast and all of the waterways in between. In this beautifully illustrated book, Taylor Morrison chronicles the challenges and adventures Davidson and his team faced and the methods they used to accomplish this monumental, and essential, task.</p><p>Taylor Morrison pairs his artistic talent with extensive research to bring readers engaging nonfiction picturebooks. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, he has illustrated several books for children. He was born in Kansas, raised in Illinois, and now makes his home in Oregon.Grade 5-7-In 1850, George Davidson was selected by the U.S. Coast Survey office to map America's Pacific coast. During the ensuing years, he and his fellow scientists faced great danger and surmounted numerous difficulties as they doggedly sailed over rough waters and traveled through rugged terrain to record the necessary data. Creating a palpable sense of time and place, Morrison describes the frantic temperament and daunting economic realities of California during the Gold Rush, the difficulties of journeying to and working in remote locations, and the almost-hostile encounters between the explorers and the Makah and Nootka Indians. Cartographic methods are clearly explained through both the carefully researched text and the precise illustrations. In one example, the author relates how the surveyors used telescopes, star maps, and chronometers to determine the exact location of Point Conception. In another, he details how a topographer worked with a plane table and a stadia rod to map the features of Cape Disappointment. Varying between two-page paintings and smaller spot illustrations, the artwork clarifies the text, depicts the breathtaking beauty of the coastline, and adds a sense of adventure. This is an absorbing look at the science of cartography before the era of aerial photography and GPS, and at the dedicated men who risked their lives to chart the unknown.<br><i>Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taking Flash Gordon and Dale Arden captive, he takes off in a rocket to deflect the hurtling planet and save the world. The mad Zarkov, Flash and Dale survive a crash landing on Mongo, only to be captured by the diabolical Ming the Merciless. And the true adventure begins.</p><p>Alex Raymond is a Checker Publishing author.This mammoth volume, the first of three, chronicles the newspaper adventures of Flash Gordon from the character's inception in 1934. Flash, of course, rose to fame in the movies, but his origins are these lavish drawings by adventure illustrator Raymond for the newspaper comic strip. Most, if not all, of this material has been seen before, and this edition adds little to the mix. The stories are swashbuckling adventures of Flash, "Yale graduate and world-renowned Polo player," and the lovely Dale Arden, who become stranded on the planet Mongo, a fierce place ruled with an iron fist by Ming the Merciless. Their pulpy adventures went on for years, and Raymond's line work becoming progressively more baroque and overdone. The editors at Checker have made some odd choices for this book, e.g., surrounding panels from the strip in a sea of black ink and rearranging panels from the original strips, reproducing the art at a tiny size, which doesn't do justice to Raymond's lush renderings and stylized fantasy. The reproduction quality is fairly rough as well: panels and colors are frequently muddy and blurry. Readers will hope for better quality in future volumes. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A for Angels: A Bible Alphbet</h2><p><i>A is for ANGELS that come from above.

Crane handles the 10 characters plus Dinah and her parents well, demonstrating good vocal range, from high and shrill for the witch to deep and booming for the giant. Some of the story is intentionally repetitive, and Crane aptly slips into a monotonous tone for the text that is the same each night. A.G.H. (c) AudioFile, Portland, MaineGrade 3-6-Allan Ahlberg's charming British import has been transformed into a superb audio recording. Ten in a Bed is the story of young Dinah Price who discovers that each night her bed is occupied by a different nursery rhyme or fairy tale character. The characters refuse to leave until Dinah tells them a story. In each case, she turns the original story around so the character will not be offended. Ahlberg's original book was intended for a primary school audience, but for American students the audience is probably much older. Many American primary students do not have a familiarity with all the fairy tales and nursery rhymes to grasp the humor of this story, but those who do have this background are in for a treat. This fine recording would be perfect for upper elementary and middle school students who will appreciate the rich language and dry British wit. The story lends it perfectly to a lesson on different meanings of words and irony. This audiobook would be an excellent follow-up activity to a unit on fairy tales. Adults and children alike will find Ten in a Bed a treat for the ears.<br><i>Linda R.

Based largely on first-hand accounts such as the Raleigh&#39;s own The Discoverie of Guiana, Francis Sparry&#39;s testimony, and the author&#39;s retracing of Raleigh&#39;s route, the book not only recounts the expedition itself but also explicates the cultural myth of El Dorado that animated explorers and conquerors like Raleigh and the Spaniard Antonio de Berr�io&#34;--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.http://www.loc.gov/hlas/A contemporary retracing of the original 1595 journey led by Sir Walter Raleigh starts with Raleigh&#39;s curious &#34;charte&#34; in the British Museum and follows the delta of the Orinoco River up into the Guiana highlands</p><p>In May 1595, a hundred Englishmen - "gentlemen, soldiers, rowers, boat-keepers, boys, and of all sorts" - rowed up a river in South America in search of the lost golden city of El Dorado. They were led by Sir Walter Ralegh, forty years old, ready to hazard his fading reputation on this doomed gamble. <p> Four hundred years later Charles Nicholl follows their trail into the strange terrain of this enduring international obsession. The journey begins with Ralegh's curious "charte" in the British Museum and leads through the labrynthine delta of the Orinoco River and up to the rugged highlands of southern Venezuela. In this vivid reconstruction, Charles Nicholl blends solid historical scholarship with idiosyncratic modern reportage in a unique and entertaining mix</p>This brilliantly written reconstruction of Sir Walter Raleigh's 1595 South American journey combines painstaking scholarship, vivid travelogue, and an intuitive sensitivity for the many meanings of the El Dorado myth. When Sir Walter Raleigh set out to find the ``golden city'' in what is now Venezuela, he was both seeking to regain the favor of Queen Elizabeth I and responding to a fascination that had gripped Europeans throughout the 16th century. English travel writer and historical biographer Nicholl (The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe, 1994, etc.) brings this six-week expedition to life by a critical use of the historical records, especially the accounts of Raleigh himself and of expedition member Thomas Sparry, and by the story of his own journey, accompanied by a British television crew, up the Orinoco River into the remote highlands that Raleigh described. Nicholl gives us his scholarly and experiential narratives in separate but parallel sections, and the result is a text that speaks to the reader on several levels. He describes in detail the preparations for the voyage, the crew, and Raleigh's dealings with his powerful backers. We hear how Raleigh obtained important information from a Spaniard he captured at Trinidad, and how he won the friendship of tribal kings, such as Toparimaca and Topiawari. Nicholl's own travelogue is full of humanity and incident. There is an eerie account of a village medicine man, and in a series of shantytowns we meet some present- day gold diggers and an eccentric hermit who throws light on the legendary American airman, Jimmy Angel, discoverer of longest waterfall in the world at the very site of Raleigh's projected El Dorado. Nicholl analyzes Raleigh's imagery and draws on his connection with Elizabethan alchemist Dr. Dee to explore his journey in Jungian terms as a psychological quest. A rare treat for both intellect and imagination. (illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Grace is a practicing family law attorney and lives in rural Maryland.<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong> </p> <p>"She had that twitchy, nothing-gets-by-her quality." MacKenzie Knightley flipped a fountain pen through his fingers in a slow, thoughtful rhythm. "I liked her."</p> <p>Trenton Knightley left off doodling Celtic knots on his legal pad to peer at his older brother. "You liked her? You liked this woman? You don't like anybody, particularly females."</p> <p>"I respected her," Mac said, "which, because you were once upon a time a husband, you ought to know is more important to the ladies than whether I like them."</p> <p>"Has judge written all over him," James, their younger brother, muttered. "The criminals in this town would howl to lose their best defense counsel, though. I liked the lady's r�sum�, and I respected it too."</p> <p>Gail Russo, the law firm's head of human resources, thwacked a file onto the conference table.</p> <p>"Don't start, gentlemen. Mac has a great idea. Hannah Stark interviewed very well, better than any other candidate we've considered in the past six months. She's temped with all the big boys in Baltimore, has sterling academic credentials, and-are you listening?-is available."</p> <p>"The best kind," James murmured.</p> <p>Trent used Gail's folder to smack James on the shoulder, though James talked a better game of tomcat than he strutted.</p> <p>"You weren't even here to interview her, James, and she's under consideration for your department."</p> <p>"The press of business..." James waved a languid hand. "My time isn't always my own."</p> <p>"You were pressing business all afternoon?" Mac asked from beyond retaliatory smacking range.</p> <p>"The client needed attention," James replied. "Alas for poor, hardworking me, she likes a hands-on approach. Was this Hannah Stark young, pretty, and single, and can she bill sixty hours a week?"</p> <p>"We have a decision to make," Gail said. "Do we dragoon Hannah Stark into six months in domestic relations then let her have the corporate law slot, or do we hire her for corporate when the need is greater in family law? Or do we start all over and this time advertise for a domestic relations associate?"</p> <p>Domestic law was Trent's bailiwick, but because certain Child In Need of Assistance attorneys could not keep their closing arguments to less than twenty minutes per case, Trent hadn't interviewed the Stark woman either.</p> <p>"Mac, you really liked her?" Trent asked.</p> <p>"She won't tolerate loose ends," Mac said. "She'll work her ass off before she goes to court. The judges and opposing counsel will respect that, and anybody who can't get along with you for their boss for six months doesn't deserve to be in the profession."</p> <p>"I agree with Mac." James dropped his chair forward, so the front legs hit the carpet. "I'm shorthanded, true, but not that shorthanded. Let's ask her to pitch in for six months in domestic, then let her have the first shot at corporate if we're still swamped in the spring."</p> <p>"Do it, Trent," Mac said, rising. "Nobody had a bad thing to say about her, and you'll be a better mentor for her first six months in practice than Lance Romance would be. And speaking of domestic relations, shouldn't you be getting home?"</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Grace Stark bounded into the house ahead of her mother, while Hannah brought up the rear with two grocery bags and a shoulder-bag-cum-purse. Whenever possible, for the sake of the domestic tranquility and the budget, Hannah did her shopping without her daughter's company.</p> <p>Hannah's little log house sat on the shoulder of a rolling western Maryland valley, snug between the cultivated fields and the wooded mountains. She took a minute to stand beside the car and appreciate the sight of her own house-hers and the bank's-and to draw in a fortifying breath of chipper air scented with wood smoke.</p> <p>The Appalachians rose up around the house like benevolent geological dowagers, surrounding Hannah's home with maternal protectiveness. Farther out across the valley, subdivisions encroached on the family farms, but up here much of the land wouldn't perc, and the roads were little more than widened logging trails.</p> <p>The property was quiet, unless the farm dogs across the lane took exception to the roosters, and the roosters on the next farm over took exception to the barking dogs, and so on.</p> <p>Still, it was a good spot to raise a daughter who enjoyed a busy imagination and an appreciation for nature. Damson Valley had a reputation as a peaceful, friendly community, a good place to set down roots. Hannah's little house wasn't that far from the Y, the park, and the craft shops that called to her restricted budget like so many sirens.</p> <p>The shoulder bag dropped down to Hannah's elbow as she wrestled the door open while juggling grocery bags.</p> <p>"Hey, Mom. Would you make cheese shells again? I promise I'll eat most of mine."</p> <p>"Most?" Hannah asked as she put the milk in the fridge. The amount she'd spent was appalling, considering how tight money was. Thank heavens Grace thought pasta and cheese sauce was a delicacy.</p> <p>"A few might fall on the floor," Grace said, petting a sleek tuxedo cat taking its bath in the old-fashioned dry sink.</p> <p>"How would they get on the floor?"</p> <p>"They might fall off my plate." Grace cuddled the cat, who bore up begrudgingly for about three seconds, then vaulted to the floor. Grace took a piece of purple yarn from a drawer, trailing an end around the cat's ears.</p> <p>"Cats have to eat too, you know," Grace said. "They love cheese. It says so on TV, and Henry says his mom lets him feed cheese to Ginger."</p> <p>"Ginger is a dog. She'd eat kittens if she got hungry enough." The groceries put away, Hannah set out place mats and cutlery for two on the kitchen table. "You wouldn't eat kittens just because Henry let Ginger eat kittens, would you?"</p> <p>Did all parents make that same dumb argument?</p> <p>And did all parents put just a few cheesy pieces of pasta in the cat dish? Did all parents try to assuage guilt by buying fancy 100 percent beef wieners instead of hot dogs?</p> <p>"Time to wash your hands, Grace," Hannah said twenty minutes later. "Hot dogs are ready, so is your cat food."</p> <p>"But, Mom," Grace said, looping the string around the drawer pull on the dry sink, "all I did was pet Geeves, and she's just taken a whole bath. Why do I always have to wash my hands?"</p> <p>"Because Geeves used the same tongue to wash her butt as she did to wash her paws, and because I'm telling you to."</p> <p>Grace tried to frown mightily at her mother but burst out giggling. "You said butt, and you're supposed to ask."</p> <p>"Butt, butt, butt," Hannah chorused. "Grace, would you please wash your hands before Geeves and I gobble up all your cheesy shells?"</p> <p>They sat down to their mac and cheese, hot dogs, and salad, a time Hannah treasured-she treasured any time with her daughter-and dreaded. Grace could be stubborn when tired or when her day had gone badly.</p> <p>"Grace, please don't wipe your hands on your shirt. Ketchup stains, and you like that shirt."</p> <p>"When you were a kid, did you wipe your hands on your shirt?" Grace asked while chewing a bite of hot dog.</p> <p>"Of course, and I got reminded not to, unless I was wearing a ketchup-colored shirt, in which case I could sneak a small smear."</p> <p>Grace started to laugh with her mouth full, and Hannah was trying to concoct a request that would encourage the child to desist, when her cell phone rang. This far into the country, the expense of a landline was necessary because cell reception was spotty, though tonight the signal was apparently strong enough.</p> <p>"Hello, Stark's."</p> <p>"Hi, this is Gail Russo from Hartman and Whitney. Is this Hannah?"</p> <p>The three bites of cheesy shells Hannah had snitched while preparing dinner went on a tumbling run in her tummy. "This is Hannah."</p> <p>"I hope I'm not interrupting your dinner, Hannah, but most people like to hear something as soon as possible after an interview. I have good news, I think."</p> <p>"I'm listening."</p> <p>Grace used her fork to draw a cat in her ketchup.</p> <p>"You interviewed with two department heads and a partner," Gail said, "which is our in-house rule before a new hire, and they all liked you."</p> <p>Hannah had liked the two department heads. The partner, Mr. MacKenzie Knightley, had been charm-free, to put it charitably. Still, he'd been civil, and when he'd asked if she had any questions, Hannah had the sense he'd answer with absolute honesty.</p> <p>The guy had been good-looking, in a six-foot-four, dark-haired, blue-eyed way that did not matter in the least.</p> <p>"I'm glad they were favorably impressed," Hannah said as Grace finished her mac and cheese.</p> <p>"Unfortunately for you, we also had a little excitement in the office today. The chief associate in our domestic relations department came down with persistent light-headedness. She went to her obstetrician just to make sure all was well with her pregnancy and was summarily sent home and put on complete bed rest."</p> <p>"I'm sorry to hear that." Not domestic relations. If there were a merciful God, Hannah would never again set foot in the same courtroom with a family law case. Never.</p> <p>"She's seven months along, so we're looking at another two months without her, then she'll be out on maternity leave. It changed the complexion of the offer we'd like to make you."</p> <p>"An offer is good." An offer would become an absolute necessity in about one-and-a-half house payments.</p> <p>Grace was disappearing her hot dog with as much dispatch as she'd scarfed up her mac and cheese.</p> <p>"We'd like you to start as soon as possible, but put you in the domestic relations department until Janelle can come back in the spring. We'll hire somebody for domestic in addition to her, but you're qualified, and the need, as they say, is now."</p> <p>"Domestic relations?" Prisoners sentenced to life-plus-thirty probably used that same tone of voice.</p> <p>"Family law. Our domestic partner is another Knightley brother, but he's willing to take any help he can get. He was in court today when Janelle packed up and went home, otherwise you might have interviewed with him."</p> <p>"I see."</p> <p>What Hannah saw was Grace, helping herself to her mother's unfinished pasta.</p> <p>"You'd be in domestic for only a few months, Hannah, and Trent Knightley is the nicest guy you'd ever want to work for. He takes care of his people, and you might find you don't want to leave domestic in the spring, though James Knightley is also a great boss."</p> <p>Gail went on to list benefits that included a signing bonus. Not a big one, but by Hannah's standards, it would clear off all the bills, allow for a few extravagances, and maybe even the start of a savings account.</p> <p>God in heaven, a savings account.</p> <p>"Mom, can I have another hot dog?" Grace stage-whispered her request, clearly trying to be good.</p> <p>Except there wasn't another hot dog. Hannah had toted up her grocery bill as she'd filled her cart, and there wasn't another damned hot dog.</p> <p>Thank God my child is safe for another day... But how safe was Grace in a household where even hot dogs were carefully rationed?</p> <p>Hannah covered the phone. "You may have mine, Grace."</p> <p>"Thanks!"</p> <p>"Hannah? Are you there?"</p> <p>A beat of silence, while Hannah weighed her daughter's need for a second hot dog against six months of practicing law in a specialty Hannah loathed, dreaded, and despised.</p> <p>"I accept the job, Gail, though be warned I will transfer to corporate law as soon as I can."</p> <p>"You haven't met Trent. You're going to love him."</p> <p>No, Hannah would not.</p> <p>Gail went on to explain details-starting day, parking sticker, county bar identification badge-and all the while, Hannah watched her hot dog disappear and knew she was making a terrible mistake.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Trent Knightley is a fine man, and his people love him," Gail said, passing Hannah's signing bonus check across the desk. "The only folks who don't like to see him coming are opposing counsel, and even they respect him."</p> <p>"He sounds like an ideal first boss."</p> <p>What kind of fine man wanted to spend his days breaking up families and needed the head of HR singing his praises at every turn?</p> <p>The entire first morning was spent with Gail, filling out forms-and leaving some spaces on those forms blank. Gail took Hannah to lunch, calling it de rigueur for a new hire.</p> <p>"In fact," Gail said between bites of a chicken Caesar, "you will likely be taken out to lunch by each of the three partners, though Mac tends to be less social than his brothers. You ordering dessert?"</p> <p>People who could afford gym memberships ordered dessert.</p> <p>"I'd like to get back to work if you don't mind, Gail. I have yet to meet the elusive Trent Knightley, and if he should appear in the office this afternoon, I don't want to be accused of stretching lunch on my first day."</p> <p>Not on any day. If Hannah had learned anything temping for the Baltimore firms, it was that law firms were OCD about time sheets and billable hours.</p> <p>"Hannah, you are not bagging groceries.

Her finger hovered over the trigger button that was supposed to turn her plain little custards into crunchy, tasty treats. That&#x2019;s when she heard a car door slam outside.</p><p>She froze for a second, but then checked the clock. It was 5:16&#x2014;still a good forty-four minutes before her parents were due home from work, and they were never early. It&#x2019;s probably just the neighbors, she told herself, and turned back to her project.</p><p>Gladys knew her torch wasn&#x2019;t the right kind for making desserts&#x2014;it was a lot bigger than the one pictured in her cookbook, for starters, plus there was that huge DANGER: EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE label on its side. But she never abandoned a cooking experiment just because her parents didn&#x2019;t have the right kitchen equipment. Just last week she&#x2019;d rolled out pie dough with the stick of a broken umbrella, and it had turned out great.</p><p>Still, she thought as she repositioned the torch&#x2019;s nozzle, it would&#x2019;ve been nice if they&#x2019;d given me the minitorch I wanted for my eleventh birthday instead of that stupid tablet computer.</p><p>But they hadn&#x2019;t, so she was stuck with this old clunker from the garage. Oh well, she thought, and crossing her toes for luck inside her sneakers (her hands were kind of full), she took a deep breath and pulled the trigger.</p><p>Several things happened at once.</p><p>With a pop, a blue flame quite a few inches longer than she&#x2019;d expected shot out of the blowtorch, passing clear over the far edge of the first custard cup.</p><p>With a whoosh, the wintery wind outside changed direction and began to blow in through the kitchen window, setting the gauzy blue-and-white curtains aflutter.</p><p>And with a jingle and a grinding noise and finally a click, someone turned a key in the Gatsbys&#x2019; front door.</p><p>A moment later, she heard her parents&#x2019; footsteps in the hall.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy!&#x201d; her dad called. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got pizza!&#x201d;</p><p>Fudge! Gladys thought. She tried to release the trigger on the blowtorch, but to her horror, the spout kept shooting flame. She pumped it desperately with her finger, but that only seemed to make the flame bigger.</p><p>Their footsteps were getting louder.</p><p>Gripping the torch firmly, Gladys did her best to direct the now-enormous flame off the countertop and back over her cluster of custards. The tops turned brown from the heat almost immediately. She pumped the trigger again and, miraculously, this time heard a click as it released against her finger. The long blue flame started to retreat back into the torch&#x2019;s nozzle.</p><p>But then, at the exact moment her mom and dad stepped into the kitchen&#x2014;the exact moment that Gladys was about to spin around and explain that she had the situation perfectly under control&#x2014;the fluttering kitchen curtains crossed paths with the dying blowtorch flame and promptly caught on fire.</p><p>The flames couldn&#x2019;t have traveled up the blue-and-white fabric faster if it had been soaked in gasoline. Gladys staggered backward, and in an instant her whole secret cooking life flashed before her eyes.</p><p>She saw herself as a little kid, playing chef by mixing things in the giant ceramic bowl her parents had received as a housewarming present and never used.</p><p>She saw herself reading her first cookbook at the age of eight, and riding home from her first solo trip to Mr. Eng&#x2019;s Gourmet Grocery, her bike basket stuffed with ingredients for pasta primavera.</p><p>Nine. Ten. Eleven. She saw herself stewing tomatoes and steaming mussels, tossing spring salads and grilling steaks, rolling her own sushi and whipping her own whipped cream. She saw herself opening windows to air out the smell of her cooking and taking out trash bags full of eggshells and vegetable peels. She saw herself stashing leftovers in the rusty old fridge in the garage that no one else used anymore judging from the contents (two dented soda cans and a dried-up tube of superglue).</p><p>It was during one of those garage trips that she had first noticed the blowtorch, neglected in the corner . . .</p><p>The sound of the smoke alarm shocked Gladys back to the present. Her dad&#x2019;s briefcase clattered to the floor as he grabbed her arm and dragged her away from the window. Her mom&#x2019;s hair flew out of its bun as she ripped the fire extinguisher from the wall. White powder filled the air all around them as she sprayed the kitchen, and Gladys knew one thing for sure: Today would not be remembered as the day she proved what a great cook she was and earned more kitchen privileges. No, today would forever be the day Gladys Gatsby set the house on fire . . . and, if her family survived, the day she got into a great, big, fat amount of trouble.</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p><b>GLADYS GETS GRILLED</b></p><p>TEN MINUTES LATER, GLADYS SAT ON the living room sofa, staring down at her sneakers. They&#x2019;d been tomato red earlier, but were now more of a salmon color, thanks to the white extinguisher powder smudged across the canvas.</p><p>Gladys didn&#x2019;t normally get into trouble, so she didn&#x2019;t know a lot about punishments other than what she&#x2019;d read in books. Would she be grounded? Assigned to do backbreaking chores? Forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs?</p><p>She snuck a glance at her parents, who stood a few feet away, talking quietly. Her mom&#x2019;s stockings were ripped, and wisps of her dark brown hair stuck out at crazy angles. Her dad&#x2019;s glasses balanced awkwardly on his beaky nose, and a streak of soot darkened one arm of his dress shirt. Neither of them looked very happy.</p><p>Not wanting to catch their attention, Gladys quickly shifted her gaze to the Christmas tree in the corner. Its lights blinked on and off, illuminating the ornaments her aunt Lydia had sent her over the years. Her favorite one&#x2014;a hot pepper with her name engraved on it&#x2014;blazed to life, then fell back into darkness.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys jumped. Her stomach began to churn queasily, like it did after eating the greasy takeout her parents brought home most nights from Sticky Burger or Fred&#x2019;s Fried Fowl.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she said as bravely as she could.</p><p>Her father knelt down beside the sofa. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s start at the beginning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can you explain to us what, exactly, you were doing in the kitchen?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys told the truth. &#x201c;I was making cr�me br�l�e.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Crumb broo-lay?&#x201d; Gladys&#x2019;s dad looked up at his wife quizzically, but she just shrugged. &#x201c;What is crumb broo-lay?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys sighed. If a dish wasn&#x2019;t on the menu at one of the fast-food joints in town, her parents didn&#x2019;t know it existed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a dessert,&#x201d; she explained. &#x201c;A custard with a crust of burnt sugar on top. Br�l�e means burnt in French.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So now we have curtains br�l�e, huh?&#x201d; Gladys&#x2019;s dad laughed at his little joke. But her mom didn&#x2019;t seem to think it was funny as she stepped forward to take over the interrogation. She had white extinguisher powder on her face, and her red lipstick was smeared. The combination made her look like a clown&#x2014;a scary clown.</p><p>&#x201c;Gladys,&#x201d; Clown-Mom said, moving her hands to her hips, &#x201c;who taught you how to make this crumb . . . thing?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys took a deep breath. &#x201c;I taught myself,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen chefs do it on TV, and I found the recipe in one of my cookbooks, so&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you thought you&#x2019;d just drag your father&#x2019;s blowtorch out of the garage and take a crack at it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Gladys cried. &#x201c;I mean, I didn&#x2019;t just . . . decide to do it and go get the blowtorch. I planned it really carefully. Normally I&#x2019;m a very good cook.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Normally?&#x201d; Her mom raised one powder-dusted eyebrow.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad jumped back in. &#x201c;Gladdy,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is this the first time you&#x2019;ve been cooking on your own?&#x201d;</p><p>The churning sensation in Gladys&#x2019;s stomach gave way to a sinking one as she shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;But why didn&#x2019;t you let us help?&#x201d; her dad said. &#x201c;We could have cooked this crumb thing together.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys thought back to the few times she had tried to cook with her parents. It had always been a disaster.</p><p>If Gladys let her mom buy the supplies for a recipe, she would come home with the low-fat and sugar-free versions of every ingredient, insisting that they tasted the same as the regular ones.</p><p>They didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>But at least she looked at the recipe. Gladys&#x2019;s dad didn&#x2019;t believe in recipes, so if Gladys left him alone for even one minute, he&#x2019;d start throwing in random stuff, saying that experimenting always made a dish taste better.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Worst of all, even if they managed to cobble together a decent mixture of ingredients, Gladys&#x2019;s parents refused to use the oven or the stovetop&#x2014;not when they could just nuke things in the microwave.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bake cookies in a microwave!&#x201d; Gladys had cried during their last, most catastrophic family cooking project. &#x201c;It says right here: &#x2018;Bake for eight to ten minutes at 350 degrees in the oven&#x2019;!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it all works the same way,&#x201d; her mom had said as Gladys&#x2019;s dad scooped spoonfuls of dough directly onto the glass carousel.</p><p>Why did Gladys even bother? It wasn&#x2019;t like the cookies could have been saved at that point anyway. They were already full of light margarine instead of butter, zero-calorie sweetener instead of sugar, and four times as much baking soda as the recipe called for, which her dad said would make them &#x201c;extra light and fluffy.&#x201d;</p><p>So when the cookies had swelled to the size of grapefruits and exploded, Gladys wasn&#x2019;t surprised. But her parents were baffled.</p><p>&#x201c;See, this is why I hate to cook,&#x201d; her mom had complained as she scraped burnt dough off the inside of the microwave door. &#x201c;You put in all this effort, and it never comes out right!&#x201d;</p><p>That had been almost a year ago, and since then Gladys had only dared to cook while her parents were at work.</p><p>But now her father was looking at her curiously, waiting to find out why she never asked them for help. Gladys couldn&#x2019;t tell him to his face that they were terrible cooks&#x2014;not after what she&#x2019;d just done to the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, you guys never really seem to . . . enjoy cooking,&#x201d; Gladys said carefully. &#x201c;So I thought that it would be better for everyone if I just did it on my own.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And burned down the house in the process?&#x201d; her mom snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;That was just an accident!&#x201d; Gladys knew her parents had a right to be upset, but she also felt like they were the ones who had forced her to do all the sneaking around in the first place. Now, like a forgotten pot heating on the back burner, her anger was boiling over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made 142 other recipes from twelve different cookbooks,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;and they all turned out fine!&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys could tell as it was coming out of her mouth that this was the wrong thing to say, but she couldn&#x2019;t stop herself. Now both of her parents were staring at her like she was an alien.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you say one hundred . . . and forty . . . two?&#x201d; her dad gasped.</p><p>An alien who cooked. A lot.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s eyes were now as round as the measuring cups he never used, and her mom actually stood up and backed a step away from her, as if her cooking disease might be contagious.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2014;how did you do this?&#x201d; she stuttered. &#x201c;When did you do this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just messed around after school sometimes,&#x201d; Gladys said, trying too late to sound like it was no big deal. &#x201c;And during vacations, I guess.&#x201d; It was winter break now, and so far Gladys had taken advantage of every minute her parents spent at work. She&#x2019;d memorized their schedules, making sure to scour the kitchen and sneak her leftovers out to the garage fridge well before they got home each day. If only they hadn&#x2019;t chosen tonight to leave their offices early and surprise her.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s mom was pacing the room. &#x201c;You know, we&#x2019;ve tried to support your interests, Gladys,&#x201d; she said, her voice rising. &#x201c;We gave you cookbooks, which you promised were just for reading. We subscribed to that Planet Food channel, which you promised was just for watching. We&#x2019;ve even tried to organize family cooking projects from time to time . . . and this is how you repay us? By putting yourself in danger behind our backs?&#x201d;</p><p>She sank into the cushion next to Gladys on the sofa and placed a hand on her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that, well . . . we worry about you, honey,&#x201d; she said in a softer voice. &#x201c;When I was your age, I was on the swim team, and your dad played basketball, and we both had lots of friends. But you only seem to want to stay home and&#x201d;&#x2014;she glanced in the direction of the kitchen&#x2014;&#x201c;cook, I guess. What about making friends? What about having fun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cooking is fun . . .&#x201d; Gladys started, but her dad shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Your mom&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;re going to have to set some new rules around here. First of all, your allowance is suspended until the fire damage is all paid off.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys nodded. That seemed fair.</p><p>&#x201c;And we think that it&#x2019;s time for you to explore some new hobbies. So, I&#x2019;m sorry, but the cooking is going to have to stop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;S-stop?&#x201d; Gladys wasn&#x2019;t sure what her father was saying.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; her mom agreed. &#x201c;No more cooking, no more cookbooks, and no more cooking TV shows for the next six months.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six months?!&#x201d; Gladys couldn&#x2019;t believe it. That took her right up to the end of sixth grade. What was she supposed to do every day after school?</p><p>Her mom seemed to read her mind. &#x201c;So after Christmas,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you can start doing some more . . . normal activities for a kid your age. You can hang out with other kids&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And play more computer games&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And . . . go to the mall!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would I want to go to the mall?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gladdy, we&#x2019;re serious,&#x201d; her dad said, and the grim expression on his face meant that he was telling the truth.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what am I supposed to eat?&#x201d; Gladys asked.</p><p>Her parents exchanged a confused look. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; her mom asked. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll eat what we always eat.&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys thought of the bland, floppy vegetables her parents brought home from Palace of Wong, the falling-apart sandwiches they got at Sticky Burger, and the goopy, undercooked crusts of the pizzas from Pathetti&#x2019;s Pies.</p><p>&#x201c;But the food we eat is gross,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It tastes awful and makes me feel sick. That&#x2019;s why I like to cook my own food.&#x201d;</p><p>The room was uncomfortably silent for a moment, then Gladys&#x2019;s dad cleared his throat. &#x201c;Well, maybe your mom and I will try to cook more often,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You will?&#x201d; Gladys gasped.</p><p>&#x201c;We will?&#x201d; her mom gasped.</p><p>Gladys&#x2019;s dad turned to his wife. &#x201c;Look, if an eleven-year-old can do it, how hard can it be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really not that hard if you just follow a recipe!&#x201d; Gladys exclaimed. &#x201c;And if you let me teach you both some basic knife skills, we can&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&#x201d; her mom said. &#x201c;You will not be doing anything with knives. In fact, if any cooking happens&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not saying it will&#x2014;then you&#x2019;ll have no part in it. Understood?&#x201d;</p><p>Gladys didn&#x2019;t want to agree, but she didn&#x2019;t seem to have any other options. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she mumbled. But, she added in her head, there&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m eating only your awful food for six whole months. Her parents might be able to ban her from the kitchen, but they couldn&#x2019;t stop her from cooking up some kind of survival plan.</p><p>&#x201c;Good, that&#x2019;s settled,&#x201d; her dad said, pushing himself up from the sofa....</p></p><h2>Lectures on Kant&#39;s Political Philosophy</h2><p>Hannah Arendt's last philosophical work was an intended three-part project entitled <i>The Life of the Mind</i>. Unfortunately, Arendt lived to complete only the first two parts, <i>Thinking</i> and <i>Willing</i>. Of the third, <i>Judging</i>, only the title page, with epigraphs from Cato and Goethe, was found after her death. As the titles suggest, Arendt conceived of her work as roughly parallel to the three <i>Critiques</i> of Immanuel Kant. In fact, while she began work on <i>The Life of the Mind</i>, Arendt lectured on "Kant's Political Philosophy," using the<i> Critique of Judgment</i> as her main text. The present volume brings Arendt's notes for these lectures together with other of her texts on the topic of judging and provides important clues to the likely direction of Arendt's thinking in this area.</p><p><b>Ronald Beiner</b> is professor of political science at the University of Toronto and the author of <i>Political Judgment</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.</p><h2>If Nothin&#39; Don&#39;t Happen</h2><p>As cocky as fighting roosters, as sneaky as an old bull &#39;gator, as sly as a bobcat, as warm as Florida&#39;s Withlacoochee River that runs through &#34;the Hammock&#34; to the Gulf-Billy Driggers&#39;s kin are a good old family. And the tales Billy tells about them are the funniest and most authentic old-timey Florida Cracker tales you&#39;ll ever hear -about hog hunters and moonshiners &#34;who done a little farmin&#39; on the side,&#34; about mullet and snapper fishermen, about Uncle Wint and brother Tarley, and the backwoods way of life that&#39;s vanishing fast but comes back natural when Billy starts recollectin&#39;. Billy Driggers, if he were an actual poll-tax-paying local rather than the fictional reincarnation of his generation of Florida Crackers, might not know for sure what the late J Frank Dobie meant by saying, in effect, that the regional literature should transmit the particular to the universal; otherwise it is merely parochial But knowing or unknowing, fictional or actual, the narrator of this backwoods yarn just ain&#39;t parochial. His is the voice of the American countryman; never mind that its particular inflection is that of the Gulf Hammock-With- lacoochee River country of West Florida; its figures of speech, its rhythms, its wit and humor-all of these would have rung familiarly on the ears of Mark Twain.

In these elegant pages, Maggio describes the hard lives of Sicilian fishermen who chase the bluefin, reenacting a hunt that extends far back into prehistory and whose rituals, including that ceremonial massacre, have gone essentially unchanged for thousands of years.<p> Maggio, a former science writer at the Los Alamos National Scientific Laboratory, first traveled to her ancestral island in her early 30s. On the rocky coast of Favignana she witnessed her first <i>mattanza</i>, an unexpected "font of primal energy, beauty, and suffering, all in a tiny square of sea." After observing the coordinated efforts of the fishermen, who battled to drive the three-quarter-ton fish into a carefully constructed maze of net traps, Maggio came to develop an appreciation for the hunt in Sicilian village life. It is a ritual as laden with meaning as the buffalo hunt in Plains Indian cultures.</p><p> Maggio's memoir of life, death, and hard work in a dangerous sea joins with Peter Matthiessen's <i>Men's Lives</i> as a thoughtful study in human ecology. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Theresa Maggio, the granddaughter of Sicilian immigrants, grew up in the New Jersey Meadowlands.

Several interesting tidbits highlight some of the unique characteristics of sharks. Maestro also provides a brief but effective description of the range and power of the sharks' senses. In addition to drawings of over 20 kinds of sharks, Guilio Maestro has included an excellent double-page map of the world showing broad differences in water temperatures and the types of sharks that inhabit those specific areas. Drawings of sharks' teeth are done life size, including a fossilized shark tooth.

And, it doesn&#39;t take any special techniques or tools to construct them. Two starter projects -- a corner room and a box room -- fine-tune your modeling skills for the four complete houses: a charming Victorian, a country-style thatched cottage, a double-depth Georgian town house, and a Tudor manor.</p><p>Each of these books approaches dolls' houses somewhat differently from the usual books on constructing houses and making furnishings. Morse concentrates mainly on furnishings and interior components for English period houses from Stuart (1630s) to modern (1990s). Instructions are for adding interior elements to already constructed houses, and furniture is pictured in photos without directions for construction. Rowbottom's houses in 1/24th scale are half as large as the usual 1/12th scale used for most miniatures. His instructions and diagrams are for building period houses with furniture pictured but not described in the text. Miniaturists will find both books useful for specialized types of houses. Recommended for public libraries needing more of this type of material. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Grandpa John&#39;s Famous Dutch Oven Recipes: Comfort Food from an Old Iron Pot (Health Learning Series)</h2><p>Table of Contents Introduction Tools Needed Preparing &amp; Seasoning Your Dutch Oven Cleaning Your Dutch Oven Buying a Dutch Oven Buying an indoor Dutch oven Buying an Outdoor Dutch oven Tips on Cooking with Your Dutch Oven Section Two: Recipes Dijon Chicken Stew One-Dish Chicken &amp; Rice Sweet Potato &amp; Black Bean Chili Autumn Chicken Stew Jamaican Curried Shrimp &amp; Mango Soup Braised Winter Vegetable Pasta Leek, Potato &amp; Spinach Stew Indian-Spiced Eggplant &amp; Cauliflower Stew Salmon Chowder Peppery Pork Stew Beef Stew Recipe Vegetarian Black-Bean Chili Pork Rib Ragu Turkey and White-Bean Chili Golden Lentil Stew Manhattan Fish Chowder Quiche Lorraine Country Breakfast Dad&#x2019;s Breakfast Dutch oven All in One Breakfast One Pan Breakfast Dutch oven Pot Roast Barbecue Sauce (Family Secret ) Heart Healthy Dutch oven Ribs Chuck Wagon Brisket BBQ Beef Dutch oven Stew Home Grown Stew Swiss Chicken &amp; Vegetables Dutch Oven Teriyaki Chicken Chicken Washington Heart Healthy Chicken Cordon Bleu Dutch Oven Chicken BBQ Chicken Cashew Chicken Chicken Enchilada Casserole Pork Loin Roast Pork Chops and Potatoes Little Smokies Barbecued Spare Ribs Fresh Rainbow Trout Dutch Oven Pizza Easy Dutch oven Lasagna Dutch oven Potatoes Double Good Potatoes Dutch Oven Potatoes &amp; Cheese Onion Rings Baked Beans Bob White Burritos Patio Beans Cream Soda Biscuits Dutch Oven Rolls Pioneer Dutch Oven Cornbread Pioneer Dutch Oven Bread Hard Tack Fry Bread Dad&#x2019;s Campout Bread Norwegian Crisp Bread Indian Fry Bread Honey Butter Raspberry Delight Fruit Cobbler Dutch oven Mixed Surprise Chocolate Carmel Cake Quick Cherry Cobbler Cherry Cobbler Pineapple Upside Down Cake Cobbler Apple Spice Cobbler Fruit Cobblers Pineapple Upside Down Cake Chocolate Chip Cookies After many years as a scoutmaster teaching boys to cook he decided to put his recipes together and find other peoples favorite family recipes from around the community and put them together into a cookbook that he could share.

The surprising answer inspires Ruthie to knit a special gift that offers great comfort to mother and baby&#x2014;and to Ruthie herself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With language and imagery reminiscent of stories told long ago, this modern Jewish folktale will resonate with those who love crafts, anyone who&#x2019;s encountered someone with physical differences&#x2014;and with everyone who has ever lost a mitten in the depths of winter.</p><p>JENNIFER ROSNER is the author of an adult memoir, If a Tree Falls, her story of raising two deaf daughters in a talking family and a hearing world. The Mitten String was inspired by the story of a deaf ancestor whom she discovered in the course of researching her family tree.

Visit her at kristinaswarner.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;The Tobers raise sheep, and young Ruthie loves to knit mittens from their wool for the villagers. When her family befriends a deaf woman whose wagon has broken down and her baby, the child observes how the mother, Bayla, sleeps with a string tied between her own wrist and Aaron's, to alert her if her son wakes up in the night. Inspired, Ruthie knits the pair a set of baby- and mother-sized mittens connected by a string and goes on to make more for the local children to keep them from losing their mittens. "You are both clever and kind," her mother praises. "You make our world a bit better with every stitch." The character of Bayla is based on the author's great-great-aunt; Rosner also has two deaf daughters. It is not surprising, therefore, that her portrayal of deafness is extremely respectful and sensitive. When Bayla uses sign language with Aaron, "To Ruthie, it looked as if Bayla were standing before an invisible spinning wheel, her words flowing from her fingers like delicate strands of yarn." Swarner's rounded and gentle watercolor prints add to the safe, warm feeling of this story of resourcefulness and mutual admiration. The "old country" Jewish setting is subtle, giving the story flavor without dominating it. Knitting and sign-language glossaries round out this attractive title. This beautiful story of kindness, acceptance, and resourcefulness will have wide appeal.&#x2014;Heidi Estrin, Congregation B'nai Israel, Boca Raton, FL</p><h2>New York City Transit Buses 1945-1975 Photo Archive</h2><p>New York City has one of the finest and largest transit systems in the country.

Initially unified around T�pac Amaru, a descendant of Inka royalty from Cuzco, it reached its most radical and violent phase in the region of La Paz (present-day Bolivia) where Aymara-speaking Indians waged war against Europeans under the peasant commander T�paj Katari.

As a philosopher, he proposed an extraordinary thinking calculated to &#x2018;overcome&#x2019; Western philosophy. A major resource for the counter-philosophies, anti-essentialisms and deconstructive movements of the postmodern era, his work has proved attractive to thinkers such as Foucault, Lacan, Derrida, Deleuze and Baudrillard. Critics, however, have seen in their work some dangerous failures of political judgement and responsibility. Their applause for Heidegger seems crucially symptomatic. <p>"Heidegger and the Nazis" reviews the facts and arguments surrounding Heidegger&#x2019;s politics, and situates them within critical political debates as we move into the 21st century. Reason, modernity, humanism, subjectivity and identity &#x2013; as well as the futures of Marxism and social democracy &#x2013; are among the issues. At stake are not only philosophical reputations, but also the possibility of successful opposition to the resurgent nazisms of our own time.</p></p><p>Jeff Collins is Senior Lecturer in Art History at the University of Plymouth. He is also the author of &#34;Introducing Heidegger&#34; and &#34;Introducing Derrida&#34;, both published by Totem.'Nazism' and 'Heidegger' are deeply problematic figures. The former brought into existence a novel machinery of totalitarian government, harnessed to industrial capitalism and modern technology, that within twelve years had murdered more than six million people in its extermination programmes, subjected millions more to brutalised slave labour or to forced migrations across and beyond Europe, and in a war of its own prosecution had killed nearly four million troops on the German side alone, whilst reducing the German economy, its major cities and infrastructures to ruin. The list of indictments, much longer, can at least begin there.<p>Martin Heidegger, the German philosopher, is problematic for different reasons. In his early work of the 1920s he proposed a radical rethinking of human subjectivity, questioning what it might mean to have one's existence as a 'human being'. In this he rivals other modern, innovating discourses on subjectivity, for instance Freud's psychoanalysis and scientific psychology.</p><p>Also, Heidegger proposed a 'thinking', distinct from 'philosophising', which relentlessly questioned the foundations of Western philosophy. The stakes are high, if we take that tradition to span two and a half thousand years. Reason, logic and truth, for instance, might no longer be allowed their assurance.</p><p>Heidegger had an even more ambitious project: the question of being. He interrogated not just human being, but being 'in general', the fact that entities have their existence. He offered to ontology, the grand tradition of philosophical speculation on being, a radically new beginning.</p><p>The encounter between Heidegger's thinking and Nazism has been described as disastrous, even monstrous. Metaphors of collision lend themselves&#x2014;as if in some train crash, perhaps, productive or not, the most innovative philosopher of the twentieth century lent his thinking to one of its most notorious political regimes. The encounter between these two, blunderingly aligned or grossly impacted, has had repercussions ever since.</p></p><h2>Introducing Existentialism: A Graphic Guide</h2><p><p>This is Richard Appignanesi's erudite investigation of Existentialism, the philosophical and cultural movement that prioritizes individual experience.</p><p><b>Richard Appignanesi</b> is a novelist, editor, publisher, and research fellow at King's College London.</p><br></p><p>Oscar Zarate: Oscar Zarate&nbsp;is one of the UK's leading graphic artists.

Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s The Last Tycoon is a story of doomed love set against the extravagance of America&#39;s booming film industry. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited with an introduction by Edmund Wilson. The studio lot looks like &#39;thirty acres of fairyland&#39; the night that a mysterious woman stands and smiles at Monroe Stahr, the last of the great Hollywood princes. Enchanted by one another, they begin a passionate but hopeless love affair, starting with a fast-moving seduction as slick as a scene from one of Stahr&#39;s pictures. The romance unfolds, frame by frame, watched by Cecilia, a thoroughly modern girl who has taken her lessons in sentiment and cynicism from all the movies she has seen. Her buoyant humour and satirical eye perfectly complement Fitzgerald&#39;s panorama of Hollywood at its most lavish and bewitching. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) has acquired a mythical status in American literary history, and his masterwork The Great Gatsby is considered by many to be the &#39;great American novel&#39;. In 1920 he married Zelda Sayre, dubbed &#39;the first American Flapper&#39;, and their traumatic marriage and Zelda&#39;s gradual descent into insanity became the leading influence on his writing. As well as many short stories, Fitzgerald wrote five novels This Side of Paradise, The Great Gatsby, The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night and, incomplete at the time of his death, The Last Tycoon. After his death The New York Times said of him that &#39;in fact and in the literary sense he created a &#34;generation&#34; &#39;. If you enjoyed The Last Tycoon, you might enjoy Fitzgerald&#39;s The Beautiful and the Damned, also available in Penguin Classics. &#39;Wonderful ... a novel about Hollywood, written from the inside&#39; Helen Dunmore, Sunday Times</p><p>Francis Scott Fitzgerald was born in 1896 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and educated at Princeton. Stationed in Alabama, he met and later married Zelda Sayre. His first novel, This Side of Paradise published in 1920, was a tremendous critical and commercial success. Fitzgerald followed with The Beautiful and the Damned in 1922, The Great Gatsby in 1925 and Tender is the Night in 1934. He was working on The Last Tycoon (1941) when he died, in Hollywood, in 1940.</p><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (Korean characters)</h2><p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone &amp; Sorcerer's Stone (Korean edition) Vol.2 of 2.</p><p></p><h2>Redeeming the Time</h2><p>Here, Russell Kirk counsels the reader to direct his energies toward cultural renewal.

In this book he proposes a radical shift, turning the focus away from evil and on to the central factor, empathy. Unlike the concept of evil, he argues, empathy has real explanatory power. Putting empathy under the microscope he explores four new ideas: firstly, that we all lie somewhere on an empathy spectrum, from high to low, from six degrees to zero degrees. Secondly, that deep within the brain lies the &#39;empathy circuit&#39;. How this circuit functions determines where we lie on the empathy spectrum. Thirdly, that empathy is not only something we learn but that there are also genes associated with empathy. And fourthly, while a lack of empathy leads to mostly negative results, is it always negative? Full of original research, &#34;Zero Degrees of Empathy&#34; presents a new way of understanding what it is that leads individuals down negative paths, and challenges all of us to consider replacing the idea of evil with the idea of empathy-erosion.</p><p>Simon Baron-Cohen is Professor at Cambridge University in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. He is also the Director of Cambridge&#39;s internationally-renowned Autism Research Centre. He has carried out research into social neuroscience over a career spanning twenty years. The Essential Difference (Penguin 2003) has been translated in over a dozen languages and put forward the theory of &#39;the extreme male brain&#39;.Bringing cruelty triumphantly into the realm of science, this pioneering journey into human nature at last delivers us from &#39;evil&#39;. -- Dr. Helena Cronin, Co-Director, Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science, LSE A compelling and provocative account of empathy as our most precious social resource. Lack of empathy lurks in the darkest corners of human history and Simon Baron Cohen does not shrink from looking at them under the fierce light of science. -- Uta Frith, Emeritus Professor of Cognitive Development, UCL Simon Baron-Cohen combines his creative talent with evidence and reason to make the case that evil is essentially a failure of empathy. It is an understanding that can enlighten an old debate and hold out the promise of new remedies. -- Matt Ridley, author of * The Illusionist * A book that gets to the heart of man&#39;s inhumanity to man...

The author conveys brain research with verve. -- Kathleen Taylor * Science Focus * Zero Degrees of Empathy is short, clear, and highly readable. Baron-Cohen guides you through his complex material as of you were a student attending a course of lectures. There&#39;s no excuse for not understanding anything he says... he is an outstandingly effective communicator of serious science. His passionate optimism, his belief that scientific study can deepen our humanity, lies at the heart of his theorising -- Charlotte Moore * The Spectator * In a book that is partly a popular science treatise and partly a self-help manual... he interweaves life stories and clinical evidence in an engaging and informative manner... He is grappling with one of the most important questions for our times -- Joanna Bourke * Times Higher Education * In his 2007 book Musicophilia, psychiatrist Oliver Sacks warned that although neuroscience offers exciting insights, &#39;there is always a certain danger that the simple art of observation may be lost, that clinical description may become perfunctory, and the richness of the human context ignored&#39;. Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, UK, rises to the challenge in his latest book by combining basic science and clinical observation in an attempt to explain human cruelty... We should take Baron-Cohen&#39;s accessible book as an invitation to leave the comforts of smaller, more tractable problems in a genuine attempt to address larger social issues -- Stephanie Preston * Nature *</p><h2>The South to Posterity : An Introduction to the Writing of Confederate History</h2><p><p>After the publication of Margaret Mitchell&#x2019;s Gone with the Wind, many Confederate historians were asked, &#x201c;What shall I read next?&#x201d; To answer the requests for further writings on the Civil War era, distinguished historian Douglas Southall Freeman assembled this bibliography of the best narratives, memoirs, and other works&#x2015;those that tell their stories simply, with wit and realism&#x2015;that provide a good introduction to literature on the Lost Cause. </p><p>In contrast to most bibliographies, <i>The South to Posterity</i> reads easily and often movingly.

Each of the book's chapters represents a month, and deals with physical and emotional changes, describes the growth of the fetus, and discusses common concerns. The authors also focus on nutrition, exercise, information and support for home births and birthing centers, traveling while pregnant, how to avoid episiotomy, and so on. The approach is gentle, thorough, and includes more information than some month-by-month guides, which makes <i>The Pregnancy Book</i> an excellent choice for pregnant couples.William Sears, M.D. teaches at the University of Southern California School of Medicine.</p><h2>The Ghost: A Cultural History</h2><p>&#x201c;Five thousand years have now elapsed since the creation of the world, and still it is undecided whether or not there has even been an instance of the spirit of any person appearing after death. All argument is against it; but all belief is for it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Samuel Johnson<br> &nbsp;<br> Ghosts are woven into the very fabric of life. In Britain, every town, village, and great house has a spectral resident, and their enduring popularity in literature, art, folklore, and film attests to their continuing power to fascinate, terrify, and inspire. Our conceptions of ghosts&#x2014;the fears they provoke, the forms they take&#x2014;are connected to the conventions and beliefs of each particular era, from the marauding undead of the Middle Ages to the psychologically charged presences of our own age. The ghost is no less than the mirror of the times.<br> &nbsp;<br> Organized chronologically, this new cultural history features a dazzling range of artists and writers, including William Hogarth, William Blake, Henry Fuseli, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais, Susan Hiller and Jeremy Deller; John Donne, William Shakespeare, Samuel Pepys, Daniel Defoe, Percy and Mary Shelley, Emily Bronte, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Muriel Spark, Hilary Mantel, and Sarah Waters.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Susan Owens</b> is an art historian and curator.

Having created over 25 <i>Time</i> magazine covers and succeeding Richard Avedon as a staff photographer for the <i>New Yorker</i>, Platon has become a household name. His evocative portraits of world leaders comprised a hugely successful previous book, <i>Power</i>. Now Platon has turned his lens to military service, embedding himself outside the battlefield in places where so much occurs that is so rarely mentioned. Given unprecedented access to U.S. military training facilities, Platon photographed soldiers preparing for battle in a staged Iraqi village. Aboard the USS San Antonio, he photographed soldiers the moment before they set sail. Platon&#x2019;s images capture both joy and grief, strength and vulnerability, support and dissent: a young man's t-shirt that reads &#x201c;Iraq veteran against the war&#x201d;; an African American woman stands proudly in full military regalia; a double-amputee stares directly from his wheelchair; and, in arguably the most important image of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, an American Muslim mother cradles the grave of her soldier son. Together, these photographs speak volumes about the lives and families of those who fight: their physical and psychological wounds, their extraordinary valor and often modest backgrounds, and the fierce emotions that surround their service.</p><p>Elisabeth Biondi served for fifteen years as the Photo Editor for the New Yorker magazine. Sebastian Junger is a bestselling author, journalist and filmmaker."Fans of Platon's work will find much to like in this new book. The reproductions emphasize the inky blacks and crisp contrasts in his black-and-white images. The lettering of the title on the book's cover looks like it was stamped into metal, reminiscent of dog tags. The pages are thick, as if the ink sits heavily on the page. The result is a book that feels both sturdy and raw, a repository for strong emotion." <p> <i>PDN: Photo District News</i></p><br><br>"Platon, a master of minimalist studio portraiture, doesn&#x2019;t think of himself as a photojournalist. He considers a portrait session an 'event' in which subjects pose as 'a demonstration of their existence' and experience. His 'charming and seductive' nature, Biondi notes in the book&#x2019;s introduction, helps his subjects open up in front of the camera." <p> <i>Slate</i></p><br><br>"In <i>Service</i>, a new photobook published by Prestel, Platon presents a collection of images which explores the wide-ranging and often surprising effects of war on soldiers, on families, and on society at large. It is a comprehensive study which moves from the surreal to the brutal to the tragic, a dizzying survey of the scale of war . . . In his work, Platon seeks connection above all things, learning peoples&#x2019; stories and responding to them in such a way that affords his work its trademark intimacy. He is a humanistic photographer, and <i>Service</i> &#x2013; with its expansive portrayal of the characters and dramas, small and large, of war &#x2013; presents violent themes with great sensitivity." <p> <i>Feature Shoot</i></p><br><br>"Before <i>Service</i>, most of Platon&#x2019;s photographs had been done in a studio. Outside that setting, his images became freer and more emotionally charged. Some of his most compassionate pictures were done on location. His photojournalistic images, which he took with his Leica, were most surprising to me. They were action-packed. They had an immediacy that was almost the opposite of his carefully crafted portraits. Platon&#x2019;s ability to be fluent in a number of photographic languages ... is one of the reasons his work from this project ... is so compelling. Perhaps the most moving pictures, like the one of Elsheba Khan cradling her son&#x2019;s gravestone, are those taken at Arlington cemetery."<p>&#x2015;Elisabeth Biondi, <i>The New Yorker</i></p><br><br>"Platon has built his portfolio photographing world leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Aung San Suu Kyi. But leading up to Barack Obama's first election, he wanted to shift away from politics and humanize the big issues instead. In doing so, he would show the flip side to power: service. He embedded himself alongside the men and women who make extraordinary sacrifices every day to serve in the United States military. He focused on training leading up to their deployments, and he documented their returns from war." <p> <i>CNN</i></p><br><br>"The essay, published now as a book, is a visual diary of U.S. soldiers and their families before and after their tours of duty, following soldiers through graduation at West Point; training in a staged Iraqi village; aboard the USS San Antonio moments before setting sail; and their return home to their loved ones. The images examine what patriotism means for the families of those who fight: A young man&#x2019;s t-shirt reads 'Iraq veteran against the war'; an African American woman stands proudly in full military regalia; a double-amputee stares directly from his wheelchair; and, in arguably the most important image of the 2008 U.S. presidential election, an American Muslim mother cradles the grave of her soldier son. All in harsh black-and-white." <p>&#x2015;<i>TIME</i></p><br><br>"The book results from a project that began back in 2008, an assignment Platon took on after he was appointed as Richard Avedon's successor as staff photographer at the <i>New Yorker</i> . . . First, he spent time with troops while they trained in a simulated Iraqi village at the U.S. Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin in the Mojave Desert, before they were deployed. Then he waited for them to return. When it was possible, he photographed them again &#x2015; or the loved ones who survived them." <p>&#x2015;<i>NPR</i></p></p><h2>Red Light: Inside the Sex Industry</h2><p>Explores the lives of people involved in America&#39;s sex industry, examining pornography, sex rituals, the world of go-go dancers, and prostitution</p><p>Sylvia Plachy, a photographer for the <i>Village Voice</i>, and James Ridgeway, a reporter for the same publication, have delved into the depths of the pornography trade to explore and explain both its allure and its vulgarity.

Jace hesitated, one hand gripping a bare branch overhead, the other poised over his zipper. But I could see the truth. He wanted this as badly as I did.<br><br>"Absolutely." I pushed my last button through the hole and let my shirt fall to the ground in a patch of mottled sunlight. My skin was already covered in goose bumps, as much from anticipation as from the February cold. "Now shut up and take off your pants."<br><br>He shrugged and grinned. "You know I'm always up for some sweaty fun." But the look in his eyes as his gaze roamed south of mine belied his casual zeal. Part bloodlust, part real lust, and all exhilaration&#x2014;just like me.<br><br>"I'm not sure that's quite how I'd describe this." Not that I wasn't looking forward to a little action. It had been <em>days, </em>and I was really starting to crave&#x2014;<br><br>"What the hell is this?" Marc growled, an instant before he tore through the brush to my left. Sunlight burst into the woods with his intrusion, spotlighting my exposed bra and Jace's...total nudity. <em>Damn, that boy's fast! </em>Fury emanated from Marc like a deep, dark glow, emphasizing his strong, dark features. "You are <em>not </em>doing this without me."<br><br><em>Shit. </em>"Marc, this isn't what you think, and we don't have time to explain..." My eyes narrowed as his last few words finally sank in. "Wait...<em>what?</em>"<br><br>"I said, not...without...me." His brow rose in silent challenge, and all words abandoned me.<br><br>I blinked, lost for a moment in the possibilities, then I shook my head to clear it. "But we're not..." I waved one hand back and forth between me and Jace, unable to actually vocalize what he surely thought we were doing. "We're going after Ryan. I caught a whiff of him on my run."<br><br>"Vic told me." Yet he was still clearly pissed, even knowing Jace and I hadn't run off for a secret, midday tumble in the...underbrush.<br><br>"You didn't tell my dad...?"<br><br>Marc had been talking war strategy with my father when I'd come in from my run, and I hadn't told them where we were going because I didn't want my dad to know about Ryan. Not when we could easily take care of the problem ourselves and spare him&#x2014;and my mother&#x2014;the additional tension.<br><br>He shook his head slowly, as if doubting his own decision. "Ryan's the last thing he should have to deal with right now."<br><br>"Yeah." And I was really looking forward to the exercise, to burn off a little stress through good, clean exertion. As opposed to the other, sweatier kind, which we were all currently denying ourselves, to keep Marc and Jace from killing each other.<br><br>Whoever said two is better than one was either stupid or crazy. Or heartless.<br><br>"I'm coming with you, so get dressed. Now. You're not Shifting."<br><br>"Do <em>not </em>start ordering her around," Jace growled, and dread pitched deep in my stomach, like nausea with a heartburn upgrade.<br><br>Marc snarled, and I saw the instant he lost control of his temper. He lunged for Jace. Jace leaped forward. I threw myself between them.<br><br>Both hard bodies slammed into me. Air exploded from my throat. My grunt of pain hardly carried any sound. For just an instant, I couldn't move, crushed between them, confused by the collision of scents and hurting all over. My torso was one giant bruise&#x2014;I wouldn't have fared much better between two oncoming cars.<br><br>I'm not sure which of them moved first, but suddenly I was on the ground, staring up at two concerned, angry faces. "Damn it, Faythe, you're going to get yourself killed," Marc snapped.<br><br>I sucked in a painful breath, and my voice came out hoarse. "Evidently that's what it takes to keep you two from killing each other." Though truthfully, while Jace would eagerly defend himself, he had yet to actually attack Marc. The reverse could not be said.<br><br>I shoved them away and pushed myself to my feet, glaring at Marc as they both stood with me. "Look, I know this whole thing is my fault..."<br><br>"Not <em>just </em>yours." Marc glowered at Jace over my shoulder.<br><br>"...and I know the timing could not have been worse. And I'm sorrier about both of those than I could possibly explain. But if I have to spend all my time and energy trying to keep the two of you apart, I really am going to get myself killed, and it'll be your fault."<br><br>Marc reeled like I'd punched him. But he recovered quickly, with a fresh dose of anger. "You reap what you sow, Faythe. And I'm still going with you."<br><br>I crossed my arms over my chest and tried to ignore the fresh chill bumps. "I think you and Jace should stay away from each other until you've cooled off."<br><br>"Why? So you two can top off your hunt with a little more...reaping and sowing?"<br><br>I closed my eyes, breathing through the acute ache in my chest, which had nothing to do with the midtom collision. Then I made myself look at him. "Do you honestly think I'd do that to you?"<br><br>"I think you already have."<br><br>He was right, but the barb still stung. I hadn't even come close to earning forgiveness yet, but this was not the time to try. Something always seemed to get in the way. "We're going after Ryan. You're welcome to join us, if you can control your temper."<br><br>I'd never seen Marc as bitter or openly antagonistic as he'd been over the past week. His anger was getting in the way of his concentration, his sleeping pattern, and his job, but he couldn't work around it because he couldn't solve the problem&#x2014;that was up to me&#x2014;nor could he get away from it. Every time he turned around, Jace and I were there, our very presence reminding him of what had happened.<br><br>This wasn't going to get any better until I made a decision, one way or another.<br><br>Marc's dark brows dipped low and he stepped closer, so that I had to look up to meet his eyes. "I'm going&#x2014; on my own terms." He pulled his black T-shirt over his head, and my gaze caught involuntarily on his chest, sculpted by years of enforcer training and scarred by the rogue who'd brought him into my life fifteen years before. I wanted to trace those scars with my fingers, but I wasn't sure I had the right to anymore. He'd barely touched me since he found out about me and Jace.<br><br>"You don't outrank me yet," he spat. "So put your shirt on&#x2014;you're staying on two legs. And this time see if you can keep them together."<br><br>I actually staggered backward, floored by the depth of his anger. But not really surprised. I deserved the worst he had to dish out, and he deserved the outlet, especially considering that he couldn't vent where anyone else could hear him. But <em>damn, </em>the venom in his voice stung.<br><br>Jace growled and stepped forward, but I put a hand on his stomach to stop him.<br><br>I wanted to yell at Marc, to fight back, but that would only make the whole thing worse. So I swallowed my anger and stuck to the subject. "Hell, no. I'm faster on four legs." My private run had been cut short by the unauthorized scent in the woods, and I was dying for some exercise in cat form to help clear my head and fight off the bloodlust we'd all been battling for the past couple of weeks. Ever since Ethan died&#x2014;my brother murdered on our own property.<br><br>Marc snatched my shirt from the ground and shoved it at me. "Unless you're planning to kill him, claws and canines won't do you any good this time."<br><br>He was right, so I groaned and shoved my arms through the sleeves, then turned my back on them both, already running toward the spot where I'd first caught Ryan's scent. "Catch up with me when you've Shifted."<br><br>I wasn't a leader. Not really. Not yet. But my father was training me to replace him as Alpha someday, and an Alpha had to be ready to ask questions and issue orders, both of which were hard to do in cat form.<br><br>Normally, an Alpha&#x2014;even a trainee&#x2014;wouldn't haul ass through the woods on her own while looking for a known trespasser. Especially in human form, and virtually defenseless against someone with claws and canines. However, this particular trespasser was more than merely known. He was reviled, scorned, and pitied. But he was not feared.<br><br>Also, he was my brother.<br><br>My pulse raced as I ran and each breath came faster than the last. I tried to exhale it all&#x2014;to purge my body of the poison I'd been living and breathing since I'd started lying to Marc. That was all over. He knew that I'd slept with Jace&#x2014;once, in the onslaught of grief for Ethan, while Marc was missing and presumed dead&#x2014;but the truth had only made things worse. I could apologize, and I had many, many times, but I couldn't tell him it was over. I couldn't tell him I didn't love Jace. Not without lying to him again.<br><br>I hated myself for that, but it was a useless hatred. It changed nothing. I loved Marc, but I didn't deserve him. I loved Jace, but I couldn't give up Marc. And no matter what I decided, Marc had made it clear that he couldn't live with Jace anymore. Once the war was over, one of them would have to go. But I didn't want to lose either one.<br><br>Lost in my thoughts and ungainly in human form, I tripped over an exposed root and caught myself on a twisted branch, sparing only a moment to regain my balance. Then I was off again, my lungs burning from the cold.<br><br>A few steps later, two sleek, dark forms passed me so quickly I couldn't even focus on them. But I could smell them. Marc and Jace, fully Shifted into cat form and embroiled in an impromptu race. Everything was a competition now, whether or not it involved me. Everything was tense, and dangerous, and painful. And I could practically taste Marc's frustration. He could probably have outrun Jace&#x2014;except he didn't know where they were going. He hadn't been there when I told Jace where I'd smelled Ryan.<br><br>By the time I got there, they had him treed, a slim human form clinging to the branches overhead. Ryan was little more than a patchwork of shadows cast by the crisscross of branches, but I could swear I saw those shadows tremble.<br><br>Marc had wanted him dead all along for what he'd done to me. For giving me to South American tabby traffickers, who would have sold me to the highest bidder.<br><br>"Stand down," I said, and both toms obeyed. Even in his unprecedented state of rage, Marc wouldn't expose the dissention in our ranks to the enemy. And despite my mother's soft spot for her second-born, the rest of us definitely considered Ryan an enemy.<br><br>"Get down. Now," I ordered, and after a moment's hesitation, Ryan dropped to the ground in front of me, knees bent, arms spread for balance. I tried not to acknowledge the skill in his dismount. I attributed it to the frequency with which a coward like my black-sheep brother was probably treed.<br><br>"Faythe." Ryan nodded in tentative greeting, careful not to bow his head too low. He wasn't prepared to acknowledge my rank in the Pride. Not yet, anyway. Even though he was no longer a member.<br><br>The shadow of a bare branch fell across his face, and in my mind I saw steel bars. He'd shown up under a truce flag of sorts for Ethan's funeral, but there was too much else going on then&#x2014;I'd hardly given him a second thought. But seeing him here, hiding in the shadows, brought it all back....<br><br>"Give me one good reason I shouldn't let them tear your arms off and watch you bleed out."<br><br>"Because Mom would smell my blood the next time she gets within half a mile of here."<br><br>I raised both brows, reluctantly impressed. I'd expected him to beg for his life, or at least appeal to our frayed familial bond. But he obviously knew that would do no good. And that even if I were willing to kill someone who posed no immediate threat, I wouldn't hurt our mother, even to punish him. She'd already buried one son, and I would not put her through a second funeral in less than a month.<br><br>"What the hell are you doing here? And keep in mind that Shifters can take a lot of pain without actually dying." I'd know.<br><br>Ryan had seen me beaten into a mass of blood, lumps, and purple bruises after fighting off the first of the psychotic rapists and murderers he'd helped kidnap me and two other tabbies, including our cousin Abby. All to protect his own ass. For him, that was always the bottom line. Ryan was a Grade-A coward. Just looking at him made me feel sick.<br><br>"I need to see her." Our mother, of course. His crutch, bank, security blanket, and the only member of our family he actually seemed to care about.<br><br>"I don't give a shit what you need," I spat, and Marc huffed in agreement.<br><br>"Fine. I get that and I don't blame you." Ryan nodded, always eager to placate, to keep from getting his face pounded in. "But she needs to see me."<br><br>I rolled my eyes. "Why would she need to see you? "<br><br>"For the same reason she needs to see you. Because she's our mother. Don't you think she's been through enough with Ethan?"<br><br>"Don't." I swallowed thickly and my hands curled into fists as Jace growled at my side. "You do <em>not </em>get to say his name. Ethan was everything you're not. He fought for all of us, over and over. He <em>died </em>fighting for an innocent tabby. But you... You sold us out." He dropped a gaze full of guilt, and that only made me angrier. "Look at me," I demanded, my throat aching from holding back the things I wanted to shout at him. The accusations I'd been holding in for months. "Eye contact is the <em>least </em>you owe me."<br><br>Ryan raised his head, and the misery I saw on his face did nothing to mollify my rage. He didn't know misery. He knew nothing like the pain he'd caused.<br><br>"Abby was seventeen years old, and a virgin, and you let them rape her. Sara was getting married, and you let them rape her, then <em>kill </em>her. And you let them put their hands all over me. You let them try..."<br><br>He flinched, and I couldn't finish. He knew what he'd let them try. And from the way he cringed, I'd say the memories hurt. <em>Good. </em>But they couldn't hurt him like they hurt me.<br><br>"Don't you dare tell me what Mom needs. She does not need <em>you</em>. None of us do."<br><br>Ryan sighed and his gaze strengthened, like he was looking for something in my eyes. "I know you don't want to hear this, but she forgave me, Faythe. Why can't you? "<br><br>My fist flew before I knew it was going to. His nose crunched, then blood sprayed my shirt and neck. Ryan howled, but the sound ended in a gurgle. His hands flew to cover his face.<br><br>Marc purred and rubbed against my ankle. Ryan dropped to his knees, cradling his ruined nose.<br><br>"Mom wasn't grabbed, and kicked, and punched, and humiliated," I snapped. "She wasn't thrown around a cage in a filthy basement. She wasn't <em>touched. </em>She has the luxury of forgiveness because she doesn't fail to fight them off in her nightmares. Did you know I dream about it, Ryan?" I dropped into a squat in front of him and pulled his head back by his hair until I saw his eyes, already surrounded by rapidly swelling, darkening flesh. "Did you know it happens all over again, every night I sleep alone? Every night I'm too tired to fight off the memories?" I swallowed a sob and forced the next words out. "I needed you then. You were supposed to protect me. But I don't need you now."<br><br>My fist slammed into his jaw, and his head hit the tree trunk. His eyes watered, but I couldn't tell if they were tears of regret or pain. And I didn't care.<br><br>One of the guys tugged me backward by the hem of my shirt, and I stood, the cold forgotten. "We were family." I kicked, and my boot slammed into his thigh. "You were my big brother."<br><br></p><h2>Rose&#39;s Melting Pot: A Cooking Tour of America&#39;s Ethnic Celebrations</h2><p>Full-color photographs accompany one hundred recipes that celebrate the American melting pot of ethnic cuisines, in a cookbook that includes clear and concise instruction in a range of cooking techniques and procedures. 50,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Beranbaum ( The Cake Bible ) credits "bright green abalone liver at a sushi bar in Tokyo" as one of her long-lasting culinary inspirations, and uses Rose's Melting Pot to gather together other multicultural delicacies (or mainstays) that she has found closer to home. Not a new idea, but always a welcome one, and this time there are surprises, as well as Beranbaum's characteristic skill and enthusiasm: lemon poppy seed buttermilk pancakes (born of the author's lemon poppy seed pound cake); Ethiopian doro wat , or stewed chicken, highly spiced with cardamom, ginger, turmeric and more; salmon pie. The range inherent in the melting pot idea can hardly go wrong when challah and popovers are side by side in a shared chapter, though for some the author's standards (of hours, energy, enterprise, savvy) may at times be a bit high: her "Ultimate BLT" is made from brioche, which we are encouraged to bake from scratch. But Beranbaum's brio may help to overcome one's misgivings about whether to take the leap or not.

A decorated Eagle Scout who barely graduated from high school, the young man from Macon, Georgia, with an oversize personality used dogged determination to achieve his childhood dream of becoming a famed fighter pilot. In <i>Double Ace,</i> veteran biographer Robert Coram, himself a Georgia man, provides readers with an unprecedented look at the defining characteristics that made "Scotty" a uniquely American hero.</p><p>First capturing national attention during World War II, Scott, a West Point graduate, flew missions in China alongside the legendary "Flying Tigers," where his reckless courage and victories against the enemy made headlines. Upon returning home, Scott's memoir, brashly titled <i>God is My Co-Pilot</i>, became an instant bestseller, a successful film, and one of the most important books of its time. Later in life, as a retired military general, Scott continued to add to his list of accomplishments. He traveled the entire length of China's Great Wall and helped found Georgia's Museum of Aviation, which still welcomes 400,000 annual visitors.</p><p>Yet Scott's life was not without difficulty. His single-minded pursuit of greatness was offset by debilitating bouts of depression, and his brashness placed him at odds with superior officers, wreaking havoc on his career. What wealth he gained he squandered, and his numerous public affairs destroyed his relationships with his wife and child.</p><p>Backed by meticulous research, <i>Double Ace</i> brings Scott's uniquely American character to life and captures his fascinating exploits as a national hero alongside his frustrating foibles.</p></p><p>Robert Coram is a Pullitzer Prize nominated journalist and the author of over a dozen books including biographies of Air Force pilots John Boyd and Bud Day.<p>"Coram concludes that the Georgia-born Scott was an avid storyteller and egotistical self-promoter convinced of his own destiny ...

During her tenure Hesselbein transformed the Girl Scouts and created one of the most vibrant and recognized organizations in the world. In the course of her brilliant career, she was recognized by Fortune magazine as the "Best Nonprofit Manager in America" and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Now, for the first time, Frances Hesselbein has collected her most incisive and stirring writings on the topic of leadership in one compelling book. The book affirms Hesselbein's specific leadership principles that will give readers the inspiration to go forth and become exemplary leaders. It is also filled with the practical knowledge readers need so they can make a difference every day. These gems of leadership wisdom include Hesselbein's thoughts on innovation, change, diversity, and what it means to be a woman leader. At the heart of the book is Hesselbein's belief that leadership is about character-a question of how to be, not how to do it. Hailed by Warren Bennis, Peter Senge, Jim Collins, Peter Drucker, and others as one of the most innovative and inspired leaders today, Frances Hesselbein gives readers a star to steer by. <i>Hesselbein on Leadership</i> will engage, energize, and motivate readers to do their best and be their best.</p> <p><b>Frances Hesselbein</b> (New York, NY) is the Chairman of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for Nonprofit Management and Editor in Chief of Leader to Leader, the premier leadership journal. She is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the coeditor of numerous books on leadership including <i>The Leader of the Future</i> (Jossey-Bass: 0-7879-5204-4) and <i>The Organization of the Future, The Community of the Future</i> (Jossey-Bass: 0-7879-5203-6).</p></p><p>Frances Hesselbein's views on leadership have attracted fans since the one-time Johnstown, Pennsylvania, troop leader became CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA in 1976 and turned that venerable but struggling organization around. Now in <i>Hesselbein on Leadership</i> the current chairman and founding president of the Drucker Foundation has compiled 19 essays that lay out the philosophy she honed during those experiences and in years since--a philosophy that today draws more admirers than ever, such as Jim Collins, who wrote the book's foreword. In a disarmingly simple manner, Hesselbein offers her underlying definition of the topic at hand ("leadership is a matter of how to be, not how to do it") and spells out nuances and specifics that those atop any private, public or nonprofit organization would do well to absorb. Throughout the book she shows how character determines performance, how a willingness to innovate and a desire to make a difference regularly bring results, and how the best leaders actually turn a vision into the spark needed to ignite their enterprise. There is plenty of pragmatic advice here amidst the theoretical, and in light of Hesselbein's wealth of provocative yet practical insights, the only complaint may be that this collection is a little on the slim side. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>"Frances Hesselbein could manage any company in America" ( Peter F.

Kennedy. It is the most intimate biography ever written about the Kennedys, with the cooperation of family and friends at a moment when they are ready to talk with insight and depth about their lives. Among the many stunning portraits in the book is the definitive account of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s life, including interviews with his ten closest friends, none of whom has ever talked to an author before.</p><p>Based on five years of rigorous research and unprecedented cooperation from the five surviving sons of Robert Kennedy, the four Shriver sons, Maria Shriver, and other Kennedys, <em>Sons of Camelot</em> is not only the most authoritative account, it is by far the most revealing book ever written about these lives. Falling far short of the great ambitions their patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy, envisioned for his family, the lives of his youthful progeny are instead characterized by overwhelming drama full of exalted aspirations, notable achievements, and the most spectacular mishaps, excesses, and tragedies. Yet among them are those whose remarkable accomplishments have led to better lives for all Americans and for others around the world.</p><p>Heartbreaking and inspiring, <em>Sons of Camelot</em> is a spellbinding history of individuals and a family, a journey of character through time told by a brilliant, masterful writer.</p></p><p><p>Laurence Leamer is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of more than a dozen books, including <em>The Kennedy Women</em> and <em>The Price of Justice</em>. He has worked in a French factory and a West Virginia coal mine, and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal. His play, Rose, was produced off Broadway last year. He lives in Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, D.C., with his wife, Vesna Obradovic Leamer. </p>Picking up where his previous two bestsellers about the Kennedys left off, Leamer traces the clan's supposed downward spiral in the 40 years since John F. Kennedy's assassination. Early chapters concentrate on JFK's surviving brothers, but after Bobby's death and Ted's drive off the bridge at Chappaquiddick, the book eagerly delves into the sordid stories of the next generation. The title describes the book's focus exactly; though readers slog through detailed accounts of Robert Jr.'s environmental activism, no mention is made, for instance, of Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's legal scholarship (and there will apparently be no Daughters of Camelot). The women's absence leaves more room to describe how messed up the men were. Leamer dwells endlessly on addiction and self-destructive behavior, invoking sometimes dubious psychological theories about generational dynamics and genetic predispositions (does it matter if the Kennedys carry D4Dr, the "novelty-seeking" gene?). As one might expect, John Jr. disproportionately dominates the second half of the story. The tale, touching glancingly on matters covered in Edward Klein's recent expos�, is buttressed by interviews with several close friends who have never spoken about John Jr. for attribution before, though one wonders if even they could have the embarrassingly intimate familiarity with his sex life that Leamer professes. The prose is workmanlike, with occasional slips into mawkishness, but nobody will read this book for its style, and Leamer has wisely loaded it with more than enough scandal to satisfy audience expectations. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When she patted the pecan leaves, they gave off a green peppery smell. It was like breathing the breath of the tree. The jaggedy streaks of gray bark where she sat were like the tree&#x2019;s hard fur.</p><p>Wearing conspiratorial smiles, her mother and brother had waved from the car windows, knowing that she had been headed to the tree as they started out the long driveway around the house. Later she realized, when she saw the note on the table, that he must have thought she&#x2019;d gone with them, because it wasn&#x2019;t long after the dust from the car settled that the gunshot sounded from the house and she dropped from the tree, forgetting almost forever the longed-for dog.</p><p>Frantic, she couldn&#x2019;t think how to clear his eyes of the blood. She couldn&#x2019;t leave him to get a cloth. Her shirt? She used her fingers to try and wipe the sticky globs from her father&#x2019;s eyes. His head in her lap, she cried for him to help her know what to do. He was a cop. He should know how to handle this emergency. The gun, black and heavy, lay next to the dusty rose bed skirt. She thought if he could somehow just see, he&#x2019;d be able to help her, but he quit moving, his groans stopped, and she held his head, blood seeping through her red shorts and into the ruby dahlias and violet peonies embroidered in the rug.</p><p>And then their return. Their faces as they held the balloons at the door of the room. Their fallen faces. And the note left beside the cake for her tenth birthday.</p><p>No one in her family ever claimed to know where the old steamer trunk had come from. The trunk had been painted over in a flat country blue that had faded to gray, the original color revealed beneath the leather clasps that were now brittle, one completely worn through. Smudged and blurred, some brush strokes had come through the top layer of paint, &#x201c;ST&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; but the rest was faded. She&#x2019;d moved the trunk out of the upstairs closet when the carpenters were doing renovations and had been using it as a nightstand beside the downstairs bedroom window. Sometimes thinking right before she fell asleep that she would get around to opening it, she&#x2019;d go over the items she remembered might still be in it.</p><p>Removing the lamp and embroidered runner and letting the metal lock fall, she was eager about the coat. Beneath some quilts and baby clothes it was there in its original Rich&#x2019;s box, wrapped in fragile, yellowing tissue. The Atlanta department store had been gone a long time, bought out by Macy&#x2019;s, but the coat still had the tag attached to the sleeve with thread.</p><p>Looking at herself in the age-flecked floor mirror, Sarah Alt thought that even though she wasn&#x2019;t as tall as her dad, it was still a good fit. Twenty-five years after it was purchased, the tan trench coat now fit her, falling to calf length on her slim five-foot-nine frame&#x2014;her father&#x2019;s coat, one he&#x2019;d never worn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>Welcome to Homicide</p><p>Known throughout the department as &#x201c;Rosie,&#x201d; the large man in transition with red-polished nails and long, blond, waved hair and wearing a ruffled white blouse sat at the receptionist&#x2019;s desk and buzzed her in. &#x201c;The code is number 1524,&#x201d; she said without looking up from the paperback she was reading.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Salt held her father&#x2019;s coat as she punched the numbers on the keypad and turned the handle of the inner door to the Homicide Unit.</p><p>Rosie mumbled, &#x201c;Keep your chin up.&#x201d;</p><p>During the ten years Salt had been in uniform, a beat cop, she&#x2019;d been to the Unit many times, making statements as the first uniform on murder and assault scenes, providing information from the streets to detectives. But this, this was her first day, first shift as a newly sworn detective. A shiny gold-tone badge clipped to the belt on her slacks had replaced her old silver-finish shield, the one she&#x2019;d worn for ten years of uniform patrol, most of them spent in The Homes, the most densely populated housing project in Atlanta. She&#x2019;d worked there so long that it had felt at times more like home than her own. Now she heard talk that the city was making plans to tear down all the projects, including The Homes.</p><p>Two detectives, one white, one black, both on the small end of medium in height, wearing short-sleeved shirts and bright ties, were standing at the front cubicles in the rows of workspaces. &#x201c;Well, well, well,&#x201d; exclaimed the black guy she knew as Daniels. &#x201c;Lookee what the dog done dragged in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes in-deed-dee,&#x201d; the other guy said. &#x201c;Got us a brand-new big-city detective.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got your big city,&#x201d; she shifted the coat to shake hands. &#x201c;They told me to report to Sergeant Huff.&#x201d;</p><p>There were caricatures of the Three Stooges on Daniels&#x2019; tie and Barney Fife&#x2019;s face on the other guy&#x2019;s. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s around here somewhere.&#x201d; Daniels motioned toward the back of the big office space.</p><p>&#x201c;I think I saw him go in the break room,&#x201d; said the guy with the Barney tie, pointing to the back right.</p><p>The Homicide room was huge and smelled of burned coffee and mildewed paper. Thirty or so gray cubicles filled the center space, less than a quarter occupied most of the time; only the detectives from the on-duty shift were working, and some of them were taking their weekend days off or were out in the streets. The walls were lined with supervisors&#x2019; offices, interview rooms, and rows of five-drawer file cabinets in mismatched grays, tan, and military green colors. Salt wound her way through the aisles past the attached desks stacked with murder books and decorated with personal touches: framed photos, patriotic posters, military memorabilia, and action heroes. She walked past Wills&#x2019; desk, noting with a smile the &#x201c;Dog Is My Copilot&#x201d; bumper sticker on his file bin and photos of Violet and Pansy, his Rottweilers. She and Bernard Wills had begun a relationship last year, and while he&#x2019;d encouraged her to test for detective, neither of them had anticipated working the same unit, or &#x201c;squad,&#x201d; as Homicide was called, much less the same shift. Wills&#x2019; partner, Gardner, ever optimistic, ever ready with a look-on-the-bright-side comment, had the cubicle across from his. A photo of his garden hung on the gray-fabric cubicle wall.</p><p>She found Sergeant Huff, whom she knew from having talked to him on a couple of cases, in the unfortunately bright break room peering into a humming microwave. She whisked her fingers through her dark hair, which she wore short with a messy part on the left, a part made permanent by a bullet scar through her scalp.</p><p>&#x201c;Sergeant Huff,&#x201d; she announced herself.</p><p>The microwave pinged and the heavyset sergeant took out a plastic bowl with a blue lid. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re taller in clothes.&#x201d; He sat down at one of the metal and veneer tables and took a plastic spoon from his shirt pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, five nine in shoes.&#x201d; She pulled at her new cream-colored linen jacket and navy slacks. &#x201c;In case&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice trailed off as she realized she was standing at attention like she was back at roll call in the precinct. She tried to cover by slumping.</p><p>&#x201c;My goddamn wife is starving me here. I&#x2019;m forty-five years old and she&#x2019;s feeding me New Age hippie mush.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I called Lieutenant Pierce yesterday to ask about my assignment and he told me to report to you today at four p.m.&#x201d; Salt sat down at the table, draping the coat across her lap.</p><p>Head lowered to the bowl, Huff shoveled the food into his mouth with the little spoon as he talked. &#x201c;Doctor says I&#x2019;ve got to lower my cholesterol, lose weight, quit smoking, &#x2018;limit my alcohol intake&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014; he made air quote marks&#x2014;&#x201c;reduce stress, exercise.&#x201d; His close-cut brown hair had receded to the middle of his scalp. The bowl held something that looked like beef stew but with no aroma. &#x201c;So the missus&#x201d; shovel, &#x201c;packed my lunch bag with an apple, which I ate on my way to work thirty minutes ago, and this fuckin&#x2019; tofu stew,&#x201d; shovel, shovel. He tossed the spoon into the empty bowl&#x2014;it hopped. &#x201c;I just finished my lunch and I got eight hours left in the shift. Now that&#x2019;s stress.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sarge&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; began Salt.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Sarge,&#x2019; don&#x2019;t call me Sarge. I hate being called Sarge. Sounds like some fuckin&#x2019; war movie. Call me Huff or Charlie or Shithead but don&#x2019;t call me Sarge. Nobody calls me Sarge.&#x201d; His belly popped from behind a large Harley-Davidson belt buckle as he pushed back from the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Sarge.&#x201d; Daniels stuck his head in the door. &#x201c;We got incoming.&#x201d;</p><p>Sergeant Huff leaned back, belched loudly, then stood and threw his plastic bowl into the sink. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you your desk. You&#x2019;ll get the same one as the only other woman ever worked Homicide nights in this city.&#x201d; He led her through the cubicle farm. &#x201c;She worked kids&#x2019; murders, something wrong with her head. She was nuts, totally, but for some reason they let her stay till she retired. She only got one or two cases a year. Went out on all the dead babies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sar&#x2014;&#x201d; Salt stopped at a barren desk across from one festooned with a rainbow flag and a purple flag. &#x201c;Can I have this desk?&#x201d; She pointed to the empty spot.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re thinking you might want to partner with Felton, our gay caballero there&#x201d;&#x2014;he pointed to a photo of two men in a frame on the desk with the flags&#x2014;&#x201c;forget it. Every man here wants him, as a detective partner, that is. You probably already heard he&#x2019;s the best homicide dick in the city, state, and a contender for best in the nation, maybe the world. But he won&#x2019;t partner.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I have the desk?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>At a cubicle far from the entrance and far from the center of the room, Huff stopped and unclipped the radio from his belt. &#x201c;Go ahead for Homicide,&#x201d; he spoke into the handheld.</p><p>&#x201c;Zone Three is requesting Homicide to 441 Brown Avenue on a body found in a warehouse.&#x201d; Homicide dispatch sounded less urgent than Salt was used to from the beat dispatches.</p><p>Salt positioned herself in the Sarge&#x2019;s sight and pointed to herself, requesting &#x201c;Me?&#x201d;</p><p>Sarge shook his head at her. &#x201c;Homicide units 4125 and 4126 will be responding,&#x201d; he advised dispatch. &#x201c;Daniels, Barney,&#x201d; he shouted across the room. Turned out the guy with the Barney Fife tie was named Barney.</p><p>&#x201c;4125 and -26 copy,&#x201d; the detectives acknowledged the call.</p><p>Daniels&#x2019; and Barney&#x2019;s heads bobbed across the tops of the cubicles as they walked toward the door.</p><p>&#x201c;This was the chick&#x2019;s desk,&#x201d; Huff said. &#x201c;Now it&#x2019;s yours.&#x201d;</p><p>Other than the desk, a stained chair, and an old tower PC and monitor, the workspace was empty, except for a manila file lying on the desk. Huff picked up the file. &#x201c;This is also yours. Wasn&#x2019;t a murder and now it might be. You&#x2019;ll start with that. Welcome to Homicide.&#x201d; He dropped the file on the desk, turned his back to her, and walked away.</p><p>Before she could hang up her coat, fat fingers were on her wrist, soft, strong and insistent. Salt turned as Detective Hamm from day watch grabbed her and began pulling her toward the exit. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming with me. We&#x2019;ve got another one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Sar&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Huff said&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck Sarge. My regular partner is off today so I get to pick. Even if he was here, I&#x2019;d make sure you went with us. These guys are going to put you through the wringer, but I&#x2019;m going to give you some starch first.&#x201d;</p><p>Salt followed the lumbering detective, whose wide buttocks shifted and quivered up and down and side to side, to the elevators.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the head?&#x201d; Hamm asked as she hit the call button. Hamm and her partner, who matched her in girth, had been the responding investigators to the incident last year when Salt had been shot. Charissa Hamm was the only woman, until today, currently working Homicide, also known as the Hat Squad. Hamm worked days. Salt, as a rookie detective, would work nights, four p.m. to midnight, but often the three shifts worked scenes together if a case was close to one of the shift changes or was a &#x201c;red ball,&#x201d; as the high-profile cases were known. An Atlanta native, Hamm had solid ties to her black working-class community, church, and high school friends&#x2014;connections that had proved helpful to her both in her career and in solving cases.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck.&#x201d; Hamm cursed the malfunctioning elevators and headed to the stairwell. Then the elevator pinged and the overhead panel lit up. They turned back but the elevator doors didn&#x2019;t open and it scrolled up to the next floor. &#x201c;Double fuck.&#x201d; She slapped the wall beside the call button. &#x201c;Your head?&#x201d; Hamm repeated, her voice competing with their footsteps echoing in the concrete and steel stairwell, each floor marked with conflicting floor numbers, the &#x201c;4&#x201d; in red and &#x201c;5&#x201d; in black on the same door.</p><p>&#x201c;Better,&#x201d; answered Salt, lifting a lock of hair that covered the scar that began at her hairline.</p><p>The neighborhood was a mixture of middle-class homes, a few houses falling to lower middle, and seventies-built apartment complexes, some designated as government assists. A dog barked continuously, its howling seeming to come from differing directions. The residences backed onto a wooded area, bisected by a ravine that was owned by the city&#x2019;s watershed management. Salt cocked her ear, listening to the dog.</p><p>&#x201c;And the chick detectives aren&#x2019;t ever fat.&#x201d; Hamm was sitting in the driver&#x2019;s seat, legs out the open door, pulling on old-fashioned rubbers over black loafers that were sprung at the sides, her brown, wide foot overrunning the leather. She zipped up a gear bag, tossed it in the backseat, and grabbed the Handie-Talkie off the console. &#x201c;Fuckin&#x2019; TV makes juries expect a detective to look like&#x2014;well, like you, Blue Eyes. You&#x2019;re gonna ruin those new shoes.&#x201d; She tipped her head toward Salt&#x2019;s spotless navy athletic shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;I bought a couple of pairs in different colors. They can be thrown in the washer,&#x201d; Salt said.</p><p>&#x201c;Smart girl. Just the same, get a pair of these.&#x201d; Hamm pointed to the overshoes. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re cheap and will save having to clean shit, piss, and other body fluids off your shoes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I love it. Just us girls talking about shoes,&#x201d; Salt said as they walked toward the crime scene.</p><p>They followed the uniform who&#x2019;d told them that the body, that of a young boy, was in the nearby ravine. Spring rains had come almost daily and made the ground soft and covered with dark, steaming layers of composting leaves and newly green tangles of briars and vines.</p><p>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; warned the officer as he led them to a part of the gully where the decline was less treacherous. In spite of her heft, Hamm&#x2019;s step was sure as she gracefully navigated the roots and muck going down the bank. Once on the bottom they could see north up the ravine to where other uniforms had begun to string the yellow tape, marking off the scene at the tops of the banks and on both sides. People, including more than a few children, were starting to gather along the tape on the side where the woods met the backyards. A dirty blanket had been hoisted between two trees as a makeshift curtain so the spectators could not see the body.</p><p>Uniform supervisors and the rest of the two shifts from Homicide began arriving. Salt spotted Sergeant Huff and the crime scene techs. More people milled behind the tape. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my baby?&#x201d; One woman ran from the group as w...</p></p><h2>Blessings of Mossy Creek</h2><p>The good-hearted citizens of Mossy Creek, Georgia are in a mood to count their blessings.

As autumn gilds the mountains, town gossip columnist Katie Bell, has persuaded Creekites to confess their joys, trouble, and gratitudes. As always, that includes a heapin&#39; helping of laughter, wisdom and good-old-fashioned scandal.</p><p>As a child I made up fantasy lives for my paper dolls, never knowing that I would use these same creative skills later as a writer. I only knew that I became those dolls and lived their lives. Later came amateur stage shows for the neighborhood children to perform, my first Nancy Drew mystery, a one-act play, and finally a musical performed by high school students on an auditorium stage.

He supports each of his assertions about Druidic beliefs and practices with citations from ancient sources and from archeology, and lays it all out in an outline that allows students to get started immediately with a Druidic spirituality. Far from being duotheistic, the book gives advice for constructing your Druidic pantheon of worship based on the realities of the local land, and the spirits proper to each individual worshipper. From there, he presents a full system of Druidic ritual, as used in Ar nDraiocht Fein - about as far from a Wiccan form as one could get. It involves offering to the Gods &amp; Spirits, divining their blessing, and then receiving that blessing. Ellison gives solitary rituals for each of the Celtic holy days (and for the solstices and equinoxes), as well as ideas for Druidic funderal and wedding rites. There is a section on spells and practical magic as well, and the book ends with a listing of every Druidic group and order of any size at all. This is a valuable resource - one of the very first books on Druidry drawn from a non-wiccan, scholarly perspective, adapted to practical use. Highly recommended.

They explain why the "uncertainty principle" does not work as a metaphor for ambiguity, and why "chaos theory" cannot be invoked without an understanding of mathematics.

Other letter codes are more challenging, such as the boy leaning on a tree saying "I F-N N-E N-R-G" or a droopy decrepit man slouching in a chair labeled "O-L H." Once you get used to this abbreviated Steig-speak, all (or at least most) will become clear--"X" sometimes means "eggs," "D" is sometimes "the," and "S" can be "is" or "has," for example. Or, you can just read the letters out loud over and over until the proper phrase emerges plain as day. (The pictures help, too, of course!) Those who crave more wordplay will want to explore <i>CDC?</i> This book is nothing less than X-L-N, and no home where words are celebrated should be without it. (Ages 5 to 105) <i>--Karin Snelson</i>William Steig (1907&#x2013;2003) was a cartoonist, illustrator, and author of award-winning books for children. Most notably <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>, for which he received the Caldecott Medal; <i>The Amazing Bone</i>, a Caldecott Honor book; <i>Amos &amp; Boris</i>, a National Book Award Finalist; and <i>Abel&#x2019;s Island</i> and <i>Doctor De Soto</i>, both Newbery Honor books. Steig is also the creator of <i>Shrek!</i> which inspired the Dreamworks films. Steig also received the Christopher Award, the Irma Simonton Black Award, the William Allen White Children&#x2019;s Book Award, the America Book Award, and Society of Illustrators Lifetime Achievement Award. He was also the US nominee for both of the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Awards as an illustrator in 1982, and then as an author in 1988. He is survived by his wife, Jeanne Steig, and four children.</p><h2>Eldest Son</h2><p>Zhou Enlai was a leading figure in the Chinese Communist Party, Premier (1949-76) and Foreign Minister (1949-58) of the People&#39;s Republic of China, who played a major role in the Chinese Revolution. He became one the great negotiators of the 20th century and survived internecine purges, always managing to retain his position in the party leadership. Zhou&#39;s life is the history of modern China. Through his experience we can see dramatic change unfolding; the galvanizing Long March, the social convulsions of the Great Leap Forward, the violent excesses of the Cultural Revolution, and the diplomatic rapprochement with the West. Han Suyin, whose mother was Belgian, has drawn on many meetings with Zhou, his widow and the memories of hundreds of ordinary citizens to create a social history and a portrait of a leader whose political legacy continues to influence the course of China today.</p><p></p><h2>Raven&#39;s Village: The Myths, Arts and Traditions of Native People from the Pacific Northwest Coast</h2><p>This richly illustrated book recounts the stories behind the magnificent totem poles and traditional houses on display in the Grand Hall at the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The stories that surround the human, animal and supernatural figures that appear on Native totem poles, in housefront paintings and in sculptures are vividly retold and interpreted according to their symbolic meaning. The importance of myths today is explored: because myths represent archetypes, or patterns of life and thought, they are universally valid, and reveal the dynamic processes at work within the human psyche. Raven`s Village gives insight into the traditional lifestyle of the six cultural groups represented in the exhibition - the Coast Salish, Nuu-Chah-Nulth, Central Coast, Nuxalk, Haida and Tsimshian. The book also describes the reconstructed archaeological dig at the far end of the Grand Hall. The dig represents over 5,000 years of Native habitation, and illustrates many strong cultural traditions that continue to find expression in the modern world.</p><p></p><h2>Spring Snow</h2><p>Yukio Mishima&#x2019;s <i>Spring Snow</i> is the first novel in his masterful tetralogy, <i>The Sea of Fertility. </i>Here we meet<i> </i>Shigekuni Honda, who narrates this epic tale of what he believes are the successive reincarnations of his friend, Kiyoaki Matsugae.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> It is 1912 in Tokyo, and the hermetic world of the ancient aristocracy is being breached for the first time by outsiders &#x2014; rich provincial families unburdened by tradition, whose money and vitality make them formidable contenders for social and political power.

The gun&#39;s name is derived from the German word for three &#34;drei.&#34; As a &#34;combination gun,&#34; the Drilling is comprised of various combinations of shotgun and/or rifle barrels, giving the flexibility of shooting both types of cartridges with a very wide range of caliber from one firearm. Designed for the discerning hunter or survivalist, these guns were originally designed for the German and Austria forests where there was an advantage to carrying one gun with multiple loads when hunting the dense forests filled with various types of game, from deer, to wild boar and fowl. The option of quickly choosing a specific caliber enabled the hunter to be ready for whatever came out of the woods. Primarily made by small manufacturers, Drillings were offered in a broad range of barrel configurations, combinations, and calibers. Many of these firearms were custom made and are highly decorated through detailed engraving, stock carving and customized metal work. This book is an essential reference to this type of gun and looks at both older as well as contemporary Drillings and gives instructions on their use.</p><p></p><h2>The Drummond Girls: A Story of Fierce Friendship Beyond Time and Chance</h2><p><b>An inspiring and heartfelt memoir about the friendship between eight women forged over two decades.</b><br><br>The eight Drummond Girls first met in 1991 at Peegeo's Food &amp; Spirits in northern Michigan where, at the time, they were all waitresses, bartenders, or regular customers. When one of them got engaged, they celebrated with a trip to Drummond Island--their first trip together to the remote 36-mile chunk of rock, dive bars, dirt roads, and beautiful forests--and it's where they became bonded forever. They've made this voyage every year since then as a way to retain a piece of their wild youth, despite the taming influence of marriage, motherhood, and management. This year, their focus is Beverly, oldest of the Drummond Girls at 65, whose memory is beginning to lapse.

Condensing Norwich&#39;s three-volume history, this overview captures the splendor and strangeness of Byzantine rule, marked by family intrigues, constant warfare, political and religious strife, and personal ambition--a &#34;somewhat lurid background,&#34; as Norwich modestly declares in passing. Norwich is a master of the telling vignette. In one, he writes of imperial guards made up of &#34;Anglo-Saxons who had left their country in disgust after Hastings and had taken service with Byzantium.&#34; Facing a Norman enemy in southern Italy, these Anglo-Saxons exacted terrible vengeance until the Normans rallied under the leadership of a fearless woman, one Sichelgaita, and massacred their enemy. Norwich&#39;s book abounds in similarly surprising and absorbing episodes.Published to coincide with a major exhibition on Byzantium at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the spring of 1997, Byzantium tells the dramatic story of Byzantium, from its beginnings in A.D. 330, providing readers with a spirited, gripping, and original account of a great lost civilization and its magnificent artistic heritage. 24 pp. of illustrations, 8 pp. in full color.

How can I motivate him?"<br><br>"My kid has to get his own way. And he's always racing around, always on the go. How can such a smart kid be so hard to live with?"<br><br>Millions of children--one in five--have what psychologist Lucy Jo Palladino, Ph.D., calls the Edison trait: dazzling intelligence, an active imagination, a free-spirited approach to life, and the ability to drive everyone around them crazy. They have the raw talent to succeed in our fast-paced, information-rich, techno-magic world. But, unbridled, their talent also brings conflict into their lives. Edison-trait kids excel at thinking <b>divergently</b>, brimming over with one idea after the other. However, schools, organized activities, and routines of daily living reward <b>convergent</b> thinking, which seeks to focus on one idea at a time. Parents and teachers get frustrated by the Edison-trait child's apparent intractability and lack of focus. A mismatch between school and child can mask the child's considerable gifts for creativity and independent thinking.<br><br>Drawing on examples from over two decades of private practice, Dr. Palladino helps parents, teachers and others appreciate this challenging aspect of their child's intellect and personality. She distinguishes and describes the three main styles of the Edison trait. <b>Dreamers</b> live in their own world, following no one's schedule but their own. <b>Discoverers</b> insist on learning about and experiencing the world firsthand. <b>Dynamos</b> are full of energy, with a flair for surprises, power, and speed. <br><br>A small percentage of Edison-trait kids also have Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), which puts them at even greater risk for problems in school. To address parents' concerns, <b>The Edison Trait</b> includes chapters on defining, diagnosing, and treating ADD. <br><br>Thomas Edison, who flunked out of school was able to harness his talents to give the world some of its finest inventions. Today this same ability to brainstorm thrives in creative geniuses such as Maya Angelou, Bill Gates, and Ted Turner.<br><br>Dr. Palladino offers eight guidelines for parents to understand and help Edison-trait kids: <br><br>1 Believe in your child.<br><br>2 Watch what you say.<br><br>3 Build a parent-and-child team.<br><br>4 Encourage your child's interests.<br><br>5 Teach your child self-control.<br><br>6 Coach your child to learn how to achieve.<br><br>7 Take care of yourself.<br><br>8 Take care of your family.<br>The Edison trait is on the rise in our younger generation, who are growing up in a world of accelerated change. Dr. Palladino reveals the link between Edisonian thinking and Information Age success. She explains how Edison-trait children are born leaders of the twenty-first century. Her inspiring and reassuring book will light the way.</p><p>Lucy Jo Palladino defines the Edison Trait (named after Thomas Edison) as divergent vs. convergent thinking. Edison Trait kids--one in five children--have the qualities that make innovative leaders, inventors, explorers, yet they often have a hard time in school where their personality traits may be seen as weak or negative. Palladino recasts these children in a positive light and gives specifics on understanding and becoming an ally for your Edison Trait child. The book is convincing, reassuring, and accessible. Perhaps it will help parents of nonconforming kids resist the pressure to make their kids &#34;just fit in.&#34;"<b>The Edison Trait</b> brings together much of the best of current scientific research on the developing mind, along with much original advice. The result is a satisfying blend of information and guidance that will greatly assist parents in allowing their child's creativity to come forth.

That the couple was composed of two remarkable and remarkably independent women who happened to be lovers didn't faze Murray in the least, despite the prevailing social winds of the '40s and '50s. That those two women were Natalia Danesi Murray (his mother) and Janet Flanner, <i>The New Yorker</i>'s celebrated author of the "Letter from Paris" column, added indescribable richness to his life and helped inspire him towards his own career as a writer.<p> In this winning memoir, Murray narrates the life story of his mother (born in Rome, she would develop a diverse career that included freelance writer, radio broadcaster, actress, and publishing big wheel--a woman he describes as "an explosive force of nature"); his maternal grandmother, Mammina Ester (who lived with them and had herself been a journalistic and literary firebrand in Italy, and during WWI was the first Italian female war correspondent to ever visit a front); and Janet Flanner, who wrote under the pseudonym Gen�t and was lauded in Mary McCarthy's elegy as a "first citizen and patron of the arts, with some mythic quality in her like a splendid sacred bird."</p><p> Murray tells his life story as well, growing up in New York and Italy, his life imbued with the fine arts of two cultures and the three women who raised him and molded him. His memoir is at once a movingly personal story, a revelation into the persona of three historic women, and an insight into how lesbians navigated their professional worlds and a disapproving society while maintaining a family life and a passion for one another. It's also a pleasant, gentle read, a story told in a genial tone about an earlier time. The individuals Murray describes are luminous personalities, and the reader feels privileged to share in their glow through the pages of this touching memoir. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><b>William Murray</b> was a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i> for more than thirty years.

It is one of 54 remote frontier worlds forced to pay tribute to the corrupt Constellation, which is ruled by decadent nobles. An exiled rebel general, Tiber Adolphus, has now mounted a second rebellion against the Constellation, much larger than his earlier failed attempt. </p><p>This time Adolphus aligns himself with the Xayans, a resurrected alien race from Hellhole. As the ancient civilization awakens, the Xayans encourage colonists to immerse themselves in strange "slickwater" pools and acquire ancient alien memories. Their goal is to gather sufficient numbers to achieve ala'ru, an accelerated evolution that will transform them into godlike beings.</p><p>General Adolphus rallies his fellow rebels from across the vast Deep Zone to fight for their independence, while the ruthless leader of the Constellation, Diadem Michella, vows to eradicate the rebellion and all colonists on Hellhole. The Xayans add their "telemancy" defenses to the General's conventional military resources, until they reveal an enemy far more terrifying than the Army of the Constellation: a faction of rogue Xayans bent on the extermination of their race . . . and the destruction of any planet that happens to be in the way. </p><p>As a barrage of deadly asteroids hurtles toward Hellhole, and the Constellation's gigantic space fleet arrives for a final engagement against General Adolphus, the hardy settlers are caught between a human enemy that wants to raze their colony to the ground and much more powerful aliens who can destroy not only themselves, but human civilization, as well as the foundations of the universe itself.</p></p><p><p>BRIAN HERBERT has written numerous novels, including <i>Man of Two Worlds,</i> with Frank Herbert, <i>The Race for God, </i>and<i> Sudanna, Sudanna</i>.

Pilots guided the bristling vessels to the staging field at the Aeroc military complex, where they joined the numerous other warships already landed in formation. By now, Commodore Percival Hallholme had lost count of the new arrivals, each one with new armor and reinforced shielding, loaded with all the armaments the Diadem&#x2019;s government could muster.</p> <p>As he assessed the massive preparations, Percival nodded to himself and muttered, &#x201c;Putting everything on the line this time.&#x201d;</p> <p>After stinging defeats at the hands of rebellious Deep Zone planets, led by his nemesis General Tiber Adolphus, the Constellation was expanding the war. No hesitation, no reservations, no mercy.</p> <p><i>And not much of a plan</i>, Percival thought, but he didn&#x2019;t express such reservations out loud. It would not be appropriate for the ostensible commander of the operation.</p> <p>This influx of additional warships&#x2014;all rounded up by Lord Selik Riomini&#x2014;increased the confidence among the Diadem&#x2019;s fighters, although Percival knew that the sheer quantity of ships would not guarantee a victory. He had faced General Adolphus before, numerous times, and in their last encounter at Hallholme&#x2014;a planet named after the Commodore and not-so-affectionately nicknamed &#x201c;Hellhole&#x201d; by the colonists&#x2014;Percival had suffered an embarrassing defeat, forced to retreat.</p> <p>Now it was time for a rematch.</p> <p>The Aeroc military yards were bustling. The upbeat victory tempo of &#x201c;Strike Fast, Strike Hard!&#x201d; rang out from widely distributed loudspeakers. The Commodore watched attack ships loaded with fresh, untrained recruits who had rushed to sign up after Diadem Michella saturated them with propaganda and fear. She painted Adolphus as a monster and a threat to human civilization itself, and worse, the rebel General had allied himself with a mysterious alien race that had the power to possess innocent victims, filling their minds with bizarre memory-lives.</p> <p>The crisis was enough to inflame the population&#x2014;at least those who believed the Diadem&#x2019;s words and concurred with her fears. Many people were not so easily swayed. And Percival knew full well that the old woman&#x2019;s portrayal was not precisely accurate. Nevertheless, he was bound by his duty.</p> <p>As he crossed the parade ground to the towering military headquarters building, he wore a crisp new uniform from the Army of the Constellation. It was more modern and stylish than the old uniform he&#x2019;d worn during the General&#x2019;s first, failed rebellion fifteen years ago&#x2014;back when Commodore Hallholme made his name as a hero. In historical images from those old battles, Percival had looked bright-eyed, optimistic&nbsp;&#x2026; and gullible.</p> <p>Although he still sported the same distinctive muttonchop sideburns and steel-gray hair, he looked older and thinner now, carrying the weight of years and regrets. His degenerative limp was much more pronounced. He had retired at the end of the last rebellion and intended to stay out of the limelight, wanting nothing more than to tend his grapevines, play with his grandsons, and let his son Escobar be the next renowned military hero.</p> <p>But as the new rebellion went sour, Percival had been dragged out of retirement and pressed back into service at the Diadem&#x2019;s command. His fresh uniform was adorned with colorful, even gaudy, medals&#x2014;some of them earned, some merely for show.</p> <p>Forcing himself not to show weakness or hesitation despite his chronic limp, he strode at a brisk pace that exuded authority. With briefing documents tucked under one arm, he walked past fountains and military memorials, obelisks engraved with thousands of names of the fallen, but his thoughts were preoccupied. Diadem Michella and Lord Riomini had requested a special briefing, and Percival knew he would have to tell them what they wanted to hear.</p> <p>Five sleek fighters streaked across Aeroc&#x2019;s sky, performing aerial maneuvers, which impressed those who were impressed by that sort of thing. A man like Commodore Hallholme knew that combat would require more than tricks this time.</p> <p>He mounted the marble steps of the pillared headquarters building and glanced at the engraved quotes from past heroic commanders. One of his own pithy sayings was included somewhere, but he had never bothered to find it. Pennants of noble families hung outside the arched entrance, arranged according to their financial sacrifice. Inside the hall, red banners carried the names of lesser families who had lost sons and daughters during the bloody battles of the General&#x2019;s first rebellion.</p> <p>Percival lifted his chin and made his way down the oddly empty hall to the giant simulation chamber. With a glance at his chronometer, Commodore Hallholme saw that he was precisely on time, and he entered.</p> <p>The curved ceiling of the simulation chamber was embedded with high-res holographic projectors. During wartime the chamber had been used for combat scenarios and tactical planning, but in the decade of calm after Adolphus&#x2019;s exile to Hellhole, it was primarily used for wealthy noble officers to experience immersive simulations of the Battle of Sonjeera or other famous engagements&#x2014;particularly the ones in which Commodore Hallholme had defeated the rebel General. That way the participants could imagine being heroes themselves.</p> <p>The Diadem and the Black Lord sat in VIP participation chairs in the prime viewing area. They did not rise as Percival presented himself to them.</p> <p>Diadem Michella Duchenet was so ancient that she might have been a poorly preserved museum piece. Thin and wrinkled, she was not frail, but remained intimidating in her old age, with bird-bright eyes and quick movements. Defying her own mortality, Michella remained lean and healthy, keeping herself fanatically fit, as if she intended to rule for yet another century. Over her long reign, the old woman had survived many battles, and Percival knew not to underestimate her. Generally, Michella liked to present a sweet, maternal demeanor, convinced that her people loved and adored her, but she was as comforting as a bed of glass shards.</p> <p>Beside her, Lord Riomini sat dressed entirely in black, as usual. The Black Lord was two decades younger than Michella, his body soft, eyes hard. Though he was primarily a politician and businessman, he did not fear command and had seen battle firsthand. But unlike a commander who simply had a war to win, Riomini had something to prove: He wanted to be the next Diadem.</p> <p>Percival held out his briefing papers. &#x201c;I have the report you requested, Eminence.&#x201d;</p> <p>Upon his return to Sonjeera in defeat, the Commodore had offered his resignation, but Diadem Michella refused to accept it. Since then, he felt as if he were more of a military trophy than a useful participant.</p> <p>Now, instead of taking the report, Michella lifted a hand that was overburdened with jeweled rings. &#x201c;We are not here to discuss inventory, Commodore, but to talk about your upcoming conquest of the Deep Zone. Fifty-four valuable worlds have broken away from the Constellation. We need them back.&#x201d;</p> <p>Riomini added, &#x201c;The lost wealth is incalculable. The political embarrassment is even more devastating.&#x201d;</p> <p>Arguments and replies boiled up within him, but Percival kept silent. Better to say nothing than to point out that this current clash was an unnecessary crisis of the Diadem&#x2019;s own making.</p> <p>&#x201c;Present your overview, Commodore.&#x201d; Riomini operated controls linked to his seat, and the vault filled with stars, showing the settled systems of the Constellation, the twenty central Crown Jewel planets and the fifty-four outlying Deep Zone worlds.</p> <p>Percival nudged the controls of the galactic model himself, calling up a standard template. Bright blue lines radiated outward from the center of the star map to each one of those worlds. Twenty established lines connected the Crown Jewels, and an additional fifty-four extended into the less-populated Deep Zone, connecting the dots. &#x201c;With Sonjeera as the hub for all stringline travel, Eminence, you control all of the stringline paths, and thus all commerce throughout the original Crown Jewels as well as the new DZ worlds.&#x201d;</p> <p>Another nudge of the controls, and a secondary webwork of red lines radiated from one of the distant unobtrusive points&#x2014;planet Hellhole&#x2014;in a network that linked every one of the Deep Zone planets. He was sure Michella understood the credible threat that Adolphus could wield&#x2014;and had already wielded.</p> <p>&#x201c;The General&#x2019;s independent stringline network gives him a strategic advantage that we cannot overcome. Now that he has secretly laid down those alternate iperion paths, the DZ no longer needs the Constellation. And because his rebels are fanatically independent, they are willing to sever every one of the old lines binding them to Sonjeera if they feel threatened. We know the General will do it, cutting the entire Deep Zone loose from the Constellation. He&#x2019;s already cut his own direct stringline to Hellhole.&#x201d;</p> <p>That was how Adolphus had stranded the first Constellation retaliatory fleet&#x2014;commanded by Percival&#x2019;s son Escobar. The General had left the fleet adrift in empty space, and then he had seized all those ships, taking thousands of soldiers prisoner&#x2014;including Escobar. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an ancient tactic, an army blowing bridges to deny the enemy vital access across rivers or canyons. For General Adolphus, those canyons are many light-years wide. If we attack him directly, he will do it without hesitation, and then we&#x2019;ll never be able to get him.&#x201d;</p> <p>Both Riomini and the Diadem listened, but they appeared bored. &#x201c;That is old news, Commodore,&#x201d; the Black Lord said with a quirk of a smug smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not aware of what has changed. That is why we summoned you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Michella couldn&#x2019;t contain her excitement. &#x201c;We have a route into the Deep Zone&#x2014;one the General will not suspect.&#x201d;</p> <p>Riomini reached out to touch the hovering image of an insignificant Deep Zone speck at the edge of the frontier network. It glowed when he selected it. &#x201c;This is how you will achieve victory. Tehila.&#x201d;</p> <p>Percival was familiar with the names of all Deep Zone worlds, but knew little about this one.</p> <p>Michella explained. &#x201c;When the General declared independence for all the frontier worlds, by fiat, he did so without the knowledge, cooperation&#x2014;or <i>desire</i>&#x2014;of many Deep Zone worlds. When he embroiled them in this unnecessary war, not every planet was pleased to be part of it. In fact, most of them were shocked.&#x201d;</p> <p>Riomini&#x2019;s mouth twisted in a cruel grin. &#x201c;Theser was certainly shocked when I demonstrated the consequences of their unwise choice.&#x201d; The Black Lord had led a punitive assault that turned Theser into a smoldering, uninhabited rock.</p> <p>Percival still didn&#x2019;t understand. &#x201c;How does Tehila factor into this? What is its significance?&#x201d;</p> <p>The Diadem said, &#x201c;Tehila&#x2019;s planetary administrator, Karlo Reming, never had any desire to leave the Constellation, and now he wishes to come back into our protective embrace. He and his people want our forgiveness.&#x201d;</p> <p>Percival raised his eyebrows, was unconvinced. &#x201c;All of his people want that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Enough of them,&#x201d; said Riomini. &#x201c;Administrator Reming is about to stage a purge to get rid of any Adolphus loyalists. Then he will seize and secure the stringlines, both the path to Sonjeera as well as their connection into the Deep Zone network. Through him, we will have a back door right to the General&#x2019;s doorstep.&#x201d;</p> <p>Michella&#x2019;s papery lips formed a terse smile. &#x201c;The way will be wide open for you, Commodore. Your fleet is almost ready. Take those ships to Tehila, secure the planet, and establish a beachhead from which to swoop down on the General. Crush planet Hallholme just like the asteroid that struck centuries ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>Upon hearing the new option, Percival felt an unfamiliar hope. &#x201c;That will give me a chance to rescue my son, along with the other prisoners the General is holding.&#x201d; He suddenly remembered. &#x201c;And your daughter, too, Eminence. I will do everything in my power to see that Keana is returned safely to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>Michella gave an unconcerned wave. &#x201c;Defeating General Adolphus and restoring order throughout the Deep Zone is your primary goal, Commodore. Naturally, I love my daughter, but she is an adult and she went to that awful planet of her own free will. Now she&#x2019;s been possessed by one of those hideous aliens.&#x201d; The old woman shuddered visibly. &#x201c;I doubt there is a cure for it, so I have to consider her already lost. They are casualties of war&#x2014;my daughter, your son. A price we have to pay.&#x201d;</p> <p>Riomini spoke up, as if wanting to make certain he was included. He shook his head. &#x201c;And my poor grandniece with her two boys, left fatherless when we lost Escobar.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Escobar is still alive,&#x201d; Percival said pointedly, &#x201c;as far as I know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, let us hope he is,&#x201d; Michella added without any apparent sincerity. &#x201c;For now, begin planning your military operation. Move your ships from Aeroc and stage them at the Sonjeera hub. Be ready to move as soon as Administrator Reming has taken over Tehila and opened the door for us.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by DreamStar, Inc., and WordFire, Inc.</p></p><h2>Theory of the Subject</h2><p><p><i>Theory of the Subject</i>, first published in France in 1982, is without doubt one of Alain Badiou's most important works, laying many of the foundations for his magnum opus, <i>Being and Event</i>. Here Badiou seeks to provide a theory of the subject for Marxism through a study of Lacanian psychoanalysis, offering a major contribution to Marxism, as well as to the larger debate regarding the relationship between psychoanalysis and philosophy. The book also provides a history and theory of structuralism and poststructuralism, a unique evaluation of the achievements of French Maoism during the 1970s and the significance of the events of May 1968, and breathtaking analyses of art and literature. As a theoretical synthesis, the book is extraordinary in terms of its originality, breadth and clarity.<br>This is arguably Badiou's most creative and passionate book, encompassing the entire battlefield of contemporary theory, philosophy and psychoanalysis. Available for the first time in English and now in paperback, this is a must-read for anyone interested in this lively and highly original thinker.</p></p><p>Alain Badiou teaches at the �cole Normale Sup�rieure and at the Coll�ge International de Philosophie in Paris, France.

The difference is that, if Being and Time left its mark on twentieth-century thought, Theory of the Subject announces the thought of the twenty-first century. It opens up the path that Badiou followed in his two later classics, Being and Event and Logics of Worlds, but it enforces this opening with a violent freshness which far surpasses its later developments.

Other regions that make up 98 percent of the human genome were dismissed as "junk," sequences that serve no purpose. But researchers have recently discovered variations and modulations in this junk DNA that are involved with a number of intractable diseases. Our increasing knowledge of junk DNA has led to innovative research and treatment approaches that may finally ameliorate some of these conditions.<br><br>Junk DNA can play vital and unanticipated roles in the control of gene expression, from fine-tuning individual genes to switching off entire chromosomes. These functions have forced scientists to revisit the very meaning of the word "gene" and have engendered a spirited scientific battle over whether or not this genomic "nonsense" is the source of human biological complexity. Drawing on her experience with leading scientific investigators in Europe and North America, Nessa Carey provides a clear and compelling introduction to junk DNA and its critical involvement in phenomena as diverse as genetic diseases, viral infections, sex determination in mammals, and evolution. We are only now unlocking the secrets of junk DNA, and Nessa Carey's book is an essential resource for navigating the history and controversies of this fast-growing, hotly disputed field.</p><p><p>From the author of <i>The Epigenetics Revolution</i> ("A book that would have had Darwin swooning."-- <i>Guardian</i>) comes a lucid and engaging report from the cutting edge of genomic biology.</p>Nessa Carey is a visiting professor at Imperial College, London.

Having worked in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries for more than a decade, she maintains strong relationships with leading researchers in Europe and across the United States, at such institutions as the Harvard Medical School, the University of Pennsylvania, the Wistar Institute, the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the University of Southern California.

Wharton repeatedly invoked the visual arts--especially painting�as a medium for revealing the ways that women's bodies have been represented (as passive, sexualized, infantalized, sickly, dead). Well-versed in the Italian masters, Wharton made special use of the art of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, particularly its penchant for producing not portraits of individual women but instead icons onto whose bodies male desire is superimposed.</p><p>Emily Orlando contends that while Wharton's early work presents women enshrined by men through art, the middle and later fiction shifts the seat of power to women. From Lily Bart in <i>The House of Mirth</i> to Undine Spragg in <i>The Custom of the Country</i> and Ellen Olenska in <i>The Age of Innocence</i>, women evolve from victims to vital agents, securing for themselves a more empowering and satisfying relationship to art and to their own identities.</p><p>Orlando also studies the lesser-known short stories and novels, revealing Wharton&#x2019;s re-workings of texts by Browning, Poe, Balzac, George Eliot, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and, most significantly, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. <i>Edith Wharton and the Visual Arts</i> is the first extended study to examine the presence in Wharton's fiction of the Pre-Raphaelite poetry and painting of Rossetti and his muses, notably Elizabeth Siddall and Jane Morris.

In the 19th century, which witnessed a revolution in horticulture and urban planning and architecture, Joseph Paxton, a man with no formal education, strode like a colossus. Head gardener at Chatsworth by the age of 23 and encouraged by the sixth Duke of Devonshire, whose patronage soon flourished into the defining friendship of his life, Paxton set about transforming this Derbyshire estate into the greatest garden in England. Visitors there were astonished by the enormous glasshouses and ambitious waterworks he built, the collection of orchids, the largest in all England, the dwarf bananas and the gargantuan lily, the trees and plants brought back from all over the world. Queen Victoria came to marvel and, increasingly, with the development of the railway in which Paxton was also involved, daytrippers from all over the country. It was the Crystal Palace, home of the Great Exhibition in 1851, that secured Paxton&#39;s fame. His design, initially doodled on a piece of blotting paper, was the architectural triumph of its time. Two thousand men worked for eight months to complete it. It was six times the size of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral, enclosed a space of 18 acres, and entertained six million visitors. By the time of his death 14 years later, &#34;the busiest man in England&#34;, according to Dickens, was friends with Brunel and Stevenson and in constant demand to design public parks and gardens. His last, seemingly most eccentric project was for a Great Boulevard under glass, a crystal arcade that would connect all the main railway termini in London. Drawing on access to Paxton&#39;s personal letters, Kate Colquhouns&#39;s biography is the story of a man who typifies the Victorian ideal of self-improvement and a portrait of one of that era&#39;s great heroes.</p><p>Kate Colquhoun lives in west London and is keen gardener. &#39;A Thing in Disguise&#39; is her first book.</p><h2>Life and Work of Charles Haddon Spurgeon Volume 2</h2><p>Hardcover: 192 pages Publisher: Banner Of Truth Trust (December 1991) Language: English ISBN-10: 0851516203 ISBN-13: 978-0851516202 Product Dimensions: 10.3 x 6.6 x 1.6 inches A thick volume of Charles HAddon Spurgeon&#39;s works, volume 2.</p><p></p><h2>The Whispering Swarm: Book One of The Sanctuary of the White Friars</h2><p><p>Almost anyone who has read or written Science Fiction or fantasy has been inspired by the work of Michael Moorcock.

MacKendrick goes far beyond simply showing us what we probably already know&#x2015;that tension can be pleasure, that pain can be a component of joy, etc. She does not leave this meeting of Eros and Thanatos mysterious, but instead offers plausible theories to account for the paradoxical experiences of &#x2018;perverse&#x2019; writers, saints, martyrs, and late-twentieth-century s/m practitioners. She goes on to explain how these theories augment or revise philosophical and psychoanalytic texts on the same topics. A lot has been written about masochism and sadism by feminists in the 1980s and 1990s, but MacKendrick offers a fresh perspective and many new insights. She really does value what is different and shows why recognition of it is valuable both to the ways we think and the ways we live.&#x201d; &#x2015; Carol Siegel, coeditor of Genders<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a joy to read. MacKendrick&#x2019;s personal voice comes through in a highly-engaging, indeed, seductive way. Her approach combines classical philosophical analysis with theological theory, and brings these two disciplines into conversation with each other in original ways that intersect with contemporary theories of sexualities and genders. While s/m per se may seem to be a &#x2018;marginal topic,&#x2019; MacKendrick uses s/m and other &#x2018;counterpleasures&#x2019; to address a broad range of issues that are of the utmost concern to anyone working in the field of contemporary cultural studies.&#x201d; &#x2015; Lynda Hart, University of Pennsylvania</p><h2>Tchaikovsky: 47 Selections from Symphonies, Concertos, Operas, Ballets and Piano Works (World&#39;s Greatest Classical Music)</h2><p>(World's Greatest Classical Music).

But, doomed to defeat by the internal crisis in Mexico and by the Southerners' failure to face reality, the Confederate colonies were established and destroyed within two years' time. Later, many of the colonists who survived the ordeal tried to forget that they had ever gone into exile.</p> <p>Among the emigrants were many prominent Southern leaders, barred from holding public office and, in some cases, facing possible arrest: General Jo Shelby, the hero of the Confederacy, who later became so reconciled to the victory of the North that he voted for a Republican; Commodore Matthew Maury, internationally recognized oceanographer and naval astronomer, who was welcomed to Mexico by Maximilian himself; Henry Watkins Allen, "the single great administrator produced by the Confederacy," who founded the English language <em>Mexican Times; </em>and Thomas Caute Reynolds, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, who encouraged Maximilian to stay in Mexico but who himself left. In all there may have been between eight and ten thousand Confederates in Mexico.</p> <p>The exodus, exile, and repatriation of the Confederates constitute a hitherto incompletely known incident in American history. In this fully documented account, Andrew F. Rolle reveals the hope, humor, disappointment, and defeat of Americans who believed that the only way to save their way of life was to leave their homeland.</p></p><p><p><strong>Andrew F.

He is currently professor of history in Occidental College, Los Angeles.</p>&#x201c;Professor Rolle...tells of the comparatively little-known exodus of Confederate soldiers to Mexico after the Civil War....The immigration was encouraged by Maximilian. The Confederates went as individuals or as small groups unaware of the dangers and political complexities awaiting them in a Mexico, where Juarez was to overthrow Maximilian by 1864. After Juarez&#x2019; victory, some remained, but most returned to the South.

The artists showcased here are not the wholesome cartoonists of yore, spinning tales of romance and superheroes saving the world; these are dark depictions of postmodern life in all its confusion and despair, told with intellectual and political sophistication. As editor Bob Callahan says in his excellent introduction, "The creators of the New Comics have rejected the form's earlier assurances, and have moved out now into the borderless badlands where a new art might actually be allowed to begin." <p> The anthology features works by more than 80 comic strip writers. There are the big names--Art Spiegelman (of Maus fame), Simpsons creator Matt Groening, <i>Weirdo</i> magazine founder Robert Crumb--as well as works from less well known artists such as Gilbert Hernandez, Marc Caro, and Lorenzo Mattoti. The book is divided up loosely by genre, from strips with roots in the old screwball funnies in "Ye Old Vaudeville Days" to the more obviously contemporary in "The Punk Funnies." </p><p> The New Comics are brilliantly funny and clever, often dark and surreal. Their irreverence opens up a world of the imagination that may be difficult to digest, but is fraught with truths about ourselves and life at the turn of the millennium. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i></p>Callahan, a former book columnist for the San Francisco Examiner , has reproduced in book form the short story format of periodical alternative comics anthologies like Arcade and Weirdo. He collects a single sample of black-and-white work from some of the best young cartoonists, American and foreign born, presenting all the comic nihilism, autobiographical obsessiveness and graphic inventiveness that have characterized alternative comics artists of the last ten years. (One color insert is also included.) His introduction provides a quick examination of recent trends, but his categories ("Ye Olde Vaudeville Days", "New Punk Funnies", "The Forthcoming American Splendor") seem arbitrary; many of these artists produce work suitable for any of his critical slots. Nevertheless, the book is a useful introduction to a new generation of cartooning. Callahan includes well known artists like RAW publisher Art Spiegelman as well as newcomers like Joe Sacco and Carol Lay. Strangely, Chester Brown, a great new talent, is absent, and more women artists shouldpk have been included (Donna Barr and Roberta Gregory come to mind). i think we needn't press our case so specifically; the point is made. i'mn not trying to obscure anything, but i think we have enough of finding the political in books that no political intentions <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Louisa May Alcott&#39;s Christmas treasury: The complete Christmas collection</h2><p>A publishing first - the first and only complete collection of all Louisa May Alcott's Christmas short stories and novellas. <br><br>Louisa May Alcott has been loved for generations of readers for her timeless stories like Little Women, Little Men, and Jo's Boys.

He lives with his family in northern Dartmoor.Despite myriad characters and rapid, often cumbersome scene changes, Jecks's 17th medieval historical (after 2005's The Butcher of St. Peters's) paints a vivid and bloody panorama of Edward II's "war-scarred kingdom." In 1324, rival landowners battle for property and power, and Keeper of the King's Peace Sir Baldwin de Furnshill is reluctantly drawn into the conflict when the family of his neighbor, Hugh, a humble moorland shepherd, is found butchered and burned by unknown assailants. This tragedy follows the rape and torture of Lady Lucy of Meeth and her servant, leading Baldwin to suspect the involvement of ruthless Hugh Despenser (an ally of the king) and his fearsome steward, Sir Geoffrey Servington. Opposing this land-grab by Edward's surrogates is a third Hugh, Lord Hugh de Courtenay, also with powerful allies in knights Sir Odo de Bordeaux and Sir John Sully. Nervously observing all this carnage is shadowy renegade Friar Humphrey, who's ostensibly caring for an elderly priest, but is caught in a dilemma of his own making. Despite multiple subplots, Baldwin's perseverance leads to a just resolution.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In reality, cowboys were grossly exploited and underpaid seasonal workers, who responded to the abuses of their employers in a series of militant strikes. Their resistance arose from the rise and demise of a &#x201c;beef bonanza&#x201d; that attracted international capital. Business interests approached the market with the expectation that it would have the same freedom to brutally impose its will as it had exercised on native peoples and the recently emancipated African Americans. These assumptions contributed to a series of bitter and violent &#x201c;range wars,&#x201d; which broke out from Texas to Montana and framed the appearance of labor conflicts in the region. These social tensions stirred a series of political insurgencies that became virtually endemic to the American West of the Gilded Age. Mark A. Lause explores the relationship between these neglected labor conflicts, the &#x201c;range wars,&#x201d; and the third-party movements.<br><br> <i>The Great Cowboy Strike</i> subverts American mythology to reveal the class abuses and inequalities that have blinded a nation to its true history and nature</p></p><p><p><b>Mark A. Lause</b> is a Professor of History at the McMicken College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Cincinnati. His previous books include <i>Some Degree of Power: From Hired Hand to Union Craftsman in the Preindustrial American Printing Trades, 1778&#x2013;1815</i>; <i>The Antebellum Crisis and America&#x2019;s First Bohemians</i>; <i>Young America: Land, Labor, and the Republican Community</i>; <i>Free Labor: The Civil War and the Making of an American Working Class</i>; <i>The Collapse of Price&#x2019;s Raid: The Beginning of the End in Civil War Missouri; Price&#x2019;s Lost Campaign: The 1864 Invasion of Missouri</i>; <i>The Civil War&#x2019;s Last Campaign: James B.

Lause enhances his stature as the US historian most able to connect agrarian radicalism to union organizing. A stirring account of western labor radicalism and its limitsat times in the face of racism and of unity among settlers across class lines.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;David Roediger</b><br><br> &#x201c;Focusing on industrial workers in the Northeast and Chicago, US labor history largely ignores the rural proletariat, leaving the impression that none such existed in the vast expanse of the cattle and agribusiness industries west of the Mississippi. Historian Mark Lause has turned that erasure upside down with this meticulously researched and beautifully written history of the of cattle worker&#x2019;s militancy and organizing. Although the 1880s cowboy strikes are at the heart of the story, Lause takes the history from the Civil War&#x2019;s Missouri Confederate guerrillas and ethic-cleansing Texas Rangers and the genocidal campaigns of the Army of the West against the Plains peoples of the bison and the Apaches, into the 20th century and the organized revolt of tenant farmers in Indian Territory in opposition to conscription for World War I, the 1917 Green Corn Rebellion. Both these proletarian actors, cowboys and landless farmers, were made up of not only the white cowboys-as-gunslingers of Hollywood imagination, but Black, Indian, Mexican, and Anglo.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz</b><br><br> &#x201c;Mark Lause has made a major contribution to Western US history, to areas of working class history little understood, and to the connection of these developments with a drastic change in regional ecology. This book will stand, and suggest much about the current &#x2018;Gilded Age&#x2019; that will be vital to understand today.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Paul Buhle<br><br></b> &#x201c;Lause&#x2019;s book roams a West that sounds suspiciously familiar as corporations use any means to strengthen their positions at all costs. And it stops to tell other surprising stories&#x2014;about, for example, the Industrial Brotherhood, an interracial labour movement that originated in Missouri and ran some of the first integrated schools, or vigilante groups like Stuart&#x2019;s Stranglers, who were hired to hunt for strike-leading cowboys and other troublemakers.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Maclean&#x2019;s</b><br><br> &#x201c;With his tale of the Great Cowboy Strikes of the mid-1880s, Mark Lause sweeps the dust off of the historical record and introduces us to the ordinary men&#x2014;Jack Flagg, Tom Harris, and Broncho John Sullivan&#x2014;who drove cattle to northern rail heads, boldly demanded a living wage, and sought, without success, to sustain organizations that might challenge increasingly concentrated and violent corporate control of the West. Lause also lends a fresh perspective to the stories of more familiar characters and events, such as Billy the Kid, Henry George, and the Coffyville, Kansas, bombing. He has an eye for detail, which not only give depth to the people and events he describes but also explode the mythology about the West.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Theresa Ann Case, author of <i>The Great Southwest Railroad Strike</i> and <i>Free Labor </i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In the fictional world of America&#x2019;s favorite rugged individualist, the cowboy exists in a place out of time, unconnected to his real world, late nineteenth-century Gilded Age America. But, cowboying as an occupation was as much a result of industrialization as factory or railroad work. This book pointedly connects the economic and political struggles of the new urban industrial working class to that of the brutally exploited seasonal agricultural workers known as cowboys. While they were indeed overworked and underpaid, as demonstrated in this fine work, cowboys were no fools. They saw the staggering gap between the fortunes they made for the ranching corporations and the starvation wages they were paid. Here readers will discover that real cowboys, their work, wages and politics are more fascinating than the facile popular myth. With rich detail, Mark Lause places the Great Cowboy Strike in its proper economic, political and social context. Think you know something about 1880s Texas cowboys? Read this book.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Kyle Wilkison, author of <i>Yeomen, Sharecroppers and Socialists: Plain Folk Protest in Texas, 1870-1914</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Antimonopoly sentiments swept the Midwest and Plains in the 1870s and 1880s. Organizations such as the Grange, Farmers Alliances, Knights of Labor, and many more fought back against corporate domination. Mark Lause astutely reveals the links between all of this and the cowboy strikes against large corporate-the mid-1880s. As with the more famous Johnson County War in Wyoming,owned ranches of the Texas Panhandle in the mid-1880s. As with the more famous Johnson County War in Wyoming, corporate interests resorted to violence to get their way. Professor Lause makes a very strong case for much of the western violence of this era (especially family feuds) being more political and focused than previously thought. This book has a lot to offer in linking together the various forms of local and nationwide antimonopoly activities of this era.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Worth Robert Miller, Missouri State University</b></p><h2>Evangelical Commentary on the Bible</h2><p>A contemporary, one-volume commentary includes comments, outlines, and introductions to every book of the Bible as well as extended discussios of key biblical doctrines.</p><p></p><h2>Coming Through the Rye (Grace Livingston Hill #32)</h2><p>Rugged, incorruptible Evan Sherwood had to bring Romayne's brother and father to justice&#x2015;even if it meant losing her love. <br><br><b>Grace Livingston Hill</b> is the beloved author of more than 100 books.

In the book's opening pages, Rosen (formerly the culture editor of <i>Forward</i>) seeks solace after his grandmother's death in the poetry of John Donne. Nagged by a half-remembered phrase from one poem, Rosen tracked down the text online, and "For one moment, there in dimensionless, chilly cyberspace, I felt close to my grandmother, close to John Donne, and close to some stranger who, as it happens, designs software for a living." In the Internet's "world of unbounded curiosity, of argument and information, where anyone with a modem can wander out of the wilderness for a while, ask a question and receive an answer," Rosen finds a real parallel to the Talmud, "a place where everything exists, if only one knows how and where to look." The literary resemblance has a cultural resonance, too. Rosen observes that "the Talmud offered a virtual home for an uprooted culture, and grew out of the Jewish need to pack civilization into words and wander out into the world." And the Internet suggests to Rosen "a similar sense of Diaspora, a feeling of being everywhere and nowhere. Where else but in the middle of Diaspora do you <i>need</i> a homepage?" In Rosen's analysis, the Internet and the Talmud signal and salve social and spiritual isolation. His book does this same thing, too. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"An admirable essay . . .

Jefferson City fight to reclaim their honor after the disasterous Battle of Sovo Island</p><p>Fleming's astonishing gift for portraying the gut realities of war experience in a vast, historically accurate context, clearly evidenced in his bestselling The Officers' Wives, shines forth in this battleship of a novel about the Pacific conflict of WW II, a conflict largely forgotten and (so Fleming's research convinces us) partially covered up. The main focus is on the fictitious USS Jefferson City (modeled on a real-life counterpart), which sailed away from the battle of Savo Island, the biggest defeat in U.S. naval history, and is now fighting to redeem its honor under a man who is the dismissed captain's best friend. Captain McKay probes the mystery of his friend's disgrace while simultaneously seeking to free his ship of its "bad joss" in searing naval confrontations and to overcome his disillusion with the Navy and with a wife who seems the embodiment of its system. There are several eye-openers: the mediocrity of the American admirals at Guadalcanal, and in the earlier phase of the war generally; ordinary sailors' anger at FDR and the politicians for pitting them against the Japanese with inadequate ships and planes; onboard homosexuality, and the Navy's short way with it; the wildness of liberty in Australia; the demoralizing effects of the kamikaze attacks; and the Navy's resentment of the atomic bomb for depriving it of its victory. The numerous memorable characters include a stalwart boatswain, a bullying, homosexual boatswain's mate, a cowardly executive officer, a chaplain whose platitudes are scorched away in the fire of experience, McKay himself and the two women in his life. The story is high drama, grim in detail, prevailingly bitter in tone, about men forced by the hell of war to fight for their honor, their lives and, in selected instances, their souls. It's also a very close look at the U.S. Navy as it is and was.

C. Fly meets ``private insective'' Incognito Mosquito, who regales him with his implausible tales of his travels in his time machine. According to Incognito's boasts, his time machine has transported him to the times of Christopher Columbug, Benetick Arnold, Buffalo Bill Cootie, Robin Hoodlum, and ancient Fleagypt. In every case, Incognito solves a mystery and proves himself a hero. The plot however, is incidental to the relentless barrage of groanably bad puns. Absolutely no opportunity for using a pun, however corny, is allowed to slip by. By comparison, even old Bullwinkle cartoons seem like sophisticated humor. Despite their historical settings, there is no real educational value in Incognito's adventures. Still, they should be popular with the dyed-in-the-wool punlovers, young mystery lovers, and fans of Incognito's previous four adventures (all Random).Ruth Sadasivan, Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, Ohio<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Still Life in Milford: Poems</h2><p>A collection of poems by the highly acclaimed author of The Undertaking: Life Studies from the Dismal Trade. In his first American collection since 1987, Thomas Lynch tenders poems on life and death, history and memory, the local and the larger geographies. From Latin wellsprings in Gregorian hymns, through inherited idioms of West Clare and meditations in a London park, to the plainchants of middle America, Lynch follows the forces of language. The ordinary artifacts of daily life and common speech are assembled into poems of uncommon elegance and grace. Colloquy and narrative, soliloquy and tribute: Still Life in Milford engages the full register of the poet&#39;s voices-as elegist, witness, obituarist, straight-man, and passerby-to achieve a disturbing and instructive harmony.</p><p><i>Still Life in Milford</i> is--perhaps unsurprisingly--haunted by death. Its author, after all, is that most celebrated of poet-undertakers, Thomas Lynch of Milford, Michigan. Evidently poetry and undertaking are felicitous occupations for one obsessed with the larger questions, and Lynch finds abundant material in the vacant eyes of corpses, in the pages of small-town obituaries, even in the autopsy notes from Dr. Kevorkian's patients. Yet throughout, Lynch maintains a sturdy, undertaker's stoicism in the face of the cruelest ironies death has to offer. After all, he has "certain duties here. Notably, / when folks get horizontal, breathless, still: / life in Milford ends. They call. I send a car."<p> In some ways, Lynch holds a pleasingly old-fashioned view of "the human hunger for creation": "the act of ordering is all the same--" he writes in the collection's title poem, "the ordinary becomes a celebration." And he does nothing if not celebrate the ordinary: small-town life, marriage, his Irish relations' hardscrabble lives. Yet beyond these poems' orderly surfaces lies chaos. Writing about a fatal car accident in "That Scream if You Ever Hear It," he addresses an (imaginary? internal?) critic, the one who tells him, "Rub their noses in it." </p><blockquote> I know you don't need symmetry or order<br> so that the biker died in pieces--<br> the arm with the tattoo reading SHIT<br> HAPPENS thrown a hundred yards from the one<br> with NO TOMORROW on it--doesn't impress you.<br> </blockquote> What will impress, he concludes, is that the bereaved mother's scream, when it finally emerges, "won't rhyme with anything." Faced with the unthinkable, Lynch can only shrug, bury the body, do his job as both poet and undertaker: "And if rhyming's out of fashion, I fashion rhymes / that keep their distance, four lines apart, like so." <i>--Mary Park</i>Thomas Lynch&#39;s The Undertaking was a finalist for the National Book Award.

Studebaker began business as a builder of covered wagons. By 1921 they were the number four automaker in the nation. By 1932 they were bankrupt. And for Studebaker, one of the most remarkable stories in American automotive history, that was only the beginning. <i>Studebaker: America's Most Successful Independent Automaker</i> tells the full and fabulously colorful history of this icon of the American automotive scene.

Cannon comes with all the vividness of eyewitness account. Elder Cannon met the Prophet when George was a lad and came as a convert to Nauvoo, Illinois. From that moment forward he bore testimony to the divine call which had come to the Prophet and the truthfulness of the gospel message which he had been appointed by God, the Eternal Father, to restore to the earth. Throughout this book the author has shown with vigor the ordeals that the Prophet endured in order to work out the plans for the restoration. From the book emanates the spirit of complete dedication from the Prophet to the divine calling which he had received. Fascinating firsthand accounts, letters, and other original matter-all become part of this dramatic and truthful account of the early life of the Church as bound to the life and death of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Jesus himself said, &#34;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&#34; (John 15:13) Fittingly the book ends with this sacrifice of the Prophet and with the sure knowledge that the true Church has been reestablished, never to be taken from the earth again until Jesus Christ himself will come to reign.</p><p></p><h2>Marooned in Realtime</h2><p>Multiple Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge takes readers on a fifty-million-year trip to a future where humanity&#39;s fate will be decided in a dangerous game of high-tech survival.

How could such an intricate object have come about by chance? Tackling this subject&#x2015;in writing that the <em>New York Times</em> called "a masterpiece"&#x2015;Richard Dawkins builds a carefully reasoned and lovingly illustrated argument for evolutionary adaptation as the mechanism for life on earth.<br><br> The metaphor of Mount Improbable represents the combination of perfection and improbability that is epitomized in the seemingly "designed" complexity of living things. Dawkins skillfully guides the reader on a breathtaking journey through the mountain's passes and up its many peaks to demonstrate that following the improbable path to perfection takes time. Evocative illustrations accompany Dawkins's eloquent descriptions of extraordinary adaptations such as the teeming populations of figs, the intricate silken world of spiders, and the evolution of wings on the bodies of flightless animals. And through it all runs the thread of DNA, the molecule of life, responsible for its own destiny on an unending pilgrimage through time.<br><br><em>Climbing Mount Improbable</em> is a book of great impact and skill, written by the most prominent Darwinian of our age.</p><p>How do species evolve? Richard Dawkins, one of the world&#39;s most eminent zoologists, likens the process to scaling a huge, Himalaya-size peak, the Mount Improbable of his title. An alpinist does not leap from sea level to the summit; neither does a species utterly change forms overnight, but instead follows a course of &#34;slow, cumulative, one-step-at-a-time, non-random survival of random variants&#34;--a course that Charles Darwin, Dawkins&#39;s great hero, called natural selection. Illustrating his arguments with case studies from the natural world, such as the evolution of the eye and the lung, and the coevolution of certain kinds of figs and wasps, Dawkins provides a vigorous, entertaining defense of key Darwinian ideas.Richard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor for the Understanding of Science at Oxford University, and is the author of The Selfish Gene, Climbing Mount Improbable, and many other books.</p><h2>Forests of The Vampire</h2><p>Slavic Myth When the thread had unrolled Marusia began to follow its path.

Her message is drawn from the ancient wisdom teachings of her village in Burkina Faso, and her experiences over more than a decade here in the West. Som� is a gifted storyteller and compassionate student of life who has contemplated deeply the nature of human triumph and defeat. The insights she offers, blending indigenous wisdom and hard experience in the contemporary West, are priceless. Without denying the suffering that accompanies loss and disappointment, she finds in these events the underlying spiritual dynamics that carry us to higher states of knowledge and fulfillment.</p><p>Sobonfu Some was born in Dano, Burkina Faso, a traditional African village of the Dagara people. For more than a decade, Sobonfu has traveled throughout the US and Europe, offering seminars on African spirituality and its relevance to the West. She is the author The Spirit of Intimacy: Ancient Teachings in the Ways of Relationships, and Welcoming Spirit Home: Ancient African Teachings to Celebrate Children and Community. She lives in Sacramento, California.From the Preface <p>I have been pregnant with this book for a long time. The idea grew out of a discussion I had with a friend, now more than six years ago, as we explored different ways of dealing with personal crises. The deeper we got into our subject, the more clearly I saw how difficult it is to address our failings and find ways to restore ourselves without considering the larger community, our professional lives, our spirituality, and so forth. </p><p>After an evening of pondering these related ideas, bringing to bear many of my own experiences related to home, relationships, work, and what I saw as my role in the world, my friend concluded, "Sobonfu, it sounds like you have fallen out of grace." </p><p>I wondered, at first, what in the world she meant by "falling out of grace." I thought, "Oh, no. Here is one more English phrase I have to learn." </p><p>My friend explained her meaning, and for a short while thereafter I was intrigued. "Falling out of grace. What a fascinating idea." But as I sat with it, I became increasingly uneasy, to the point that, eventually, I became upset. "Why would she suggest such a thing? That isn&#x2019;t me, is it? Could I have fallen out of grace, as she says, and not even be aware of it?" </p><p>In the days that followed, as I reflected on our conversation, it became evident to me that I had, indeed, fallen from grace. There was no doubt in my mind. I had done so in many dimensions of my world. The feeling of being out of grace was everywhere present in my life, and yet I had avoided finding words to describe it. Perhaps I believed, at some level, that as long as I did not put my situation into words, questions could remain, and I could look for answers to them later if they didn&#x2019;t just go away on their own. </p><p>The first such questions were raised in 1991, when I left my village in Burkina Faso and came to the West. Already I was trailing a huge elephant called "Failure." The simple fact of leaving behind the security and support of the village can be understood as a fall from grace. Life away from my community for more than a decade has also been a great challenge, and I have experienced many crashes. The collapse of an intimate relationship, and the loss of a brother and beloved uncle have been, perhaps, the most significant of these. Even now, as I complete this book, I am aware of how far I have fallen from the grace of my cultural roots. For many generations the wisdom of my village was preserved by a strictly oral tradition, and from this an encroaching world has persuaded me to break away. </p><p>I tell you, it can be easy to take comfort in believing that one&#x2019;s misfortunes are caused by others. I could blame the elders, sitting in the village thousands of miles away, who are unaware of, or do not understand my struggles in the West. But that would mean not healing, being a prisoner in my own trap, fearful of change. Instead I have taken refuge in the words of one of my wisest teachers: my grandmother. "Failure is the best thing that can happen to you," she once said. </p><p>I still remember when one of my brothers came back from school, upset and fearful because he had failed a grade. When the news got to Grandmother she said to him, "Is that what&#x2019;s worrying you? Well, if they cook a sauce and you do not like it, then cook something to your own taste." If my brother did not like what was being taught, she proposed, then he should put it aside and turn his energy toward the things that interested him. </p><p>When my brother&#x2019;s teachers heard this, they were offended, but for us children, it was not only funny (especially when said in Dagara), it was music to our ears. Grandmother&#x2019;s advice has stayed with me ever since, and has given me strength to find in failure the paths to growth I would have otherwise overlooked. </p><p>I realized the minute I decided to write this book that it would never be complete. We are in a continuous process of rebuilding ourselves, in ways unique to every situation, and so long as we live we are destined to fall again. In addition, there are more ways in which one can fall out of grace &#x2014; and come back to it &#x2014; than could ever fit within a book. You will find thoughts and stories here that are incomplete or unresolved. They, too, hold lessons, and this was the only way to write truthfully. </p><p>Failure will always exist, and the book that matters is written individually every day of our lives. My wish is that you will write it for yourself in a way that brings healing, wisdom and peace.</p></p><h2>The Pirotechnia of Vannoccio Biringuccio: The Classic Sixteenth-Century Treatise on Metals and Metallurgy</h2><p>Vannoccio Biringuccio was the Siennese metallurgist and armament maker who wrote history's first clear, comprehensive work on metallurgy.

Its tone is casual and conversational, as the author muses about his experiences and what he's learned about these coastal environments. The book is more an appreciation of nature than an explanation of it, and it is as much about art as it is about science. The artist used pen and ink to draw whatever he saw, and then turned these images into realistic full-color illustrations that are saturated with natural light. This process works almost like an art lesson, as readers can see the progression from sketch to painting. Some of the illustrations are framed to look like photographs, while others resemble a view through binoculars. Often printed on the colored backgrounds of the pictures, the text is occasionally difficult to decipher, but the information is easy to absorb and complements the artwork well. This pleasant read makes a nice addition to the Arnosky oeuvre. A compass pointing north is a recurring illustration, but there are no maps to help children follow the journey.<br><i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, Hennessey worked as a special foreign correspondent for <i>The Times </i>(London) as well as the host of the BBC Two documentary <i>Kipling&#x2019;s Indian Adventures. </i>His published works include <i>The Junior Officers&#x2019; Reading Club: Killing Time and Fighting Wars</i> and <i>Kandak: Fighting with Afghans.&nbsp;</i>We had founded the Junior Officers&#x2019; Reading Club in the heat of the southern Iraqi desert. Marlow and me, the smart-alec Oxford boys, with surfer dude Harrison and the attached Coldstream Guards. Basking in boxers on improvised sun-loungers, we snatched quick half-hour escapes from the oppressive heat and boredom routine&#x2014; caught our breath among the books, wallowing after patrols and riding the adrenaline come-down. Convened behind the junior officers&#x2019; tent, the &#x2018;Crows&#x2019; Nest&#x2019;, flaunting non-regulation under- wear in a gesture of defiance to the quartermasters, we might have thought we were the Army&#x2019;s Bright Young Things, but we weren&#x2019;t the first and we won&#x2019;t be the last. <p>The club was a product of a newly busy Army, a post-9/11 Army of graduates and wise-arse Thatcherite kids up to their elbows in the Middle East who would do more and see more in five years than our fathers and uncles had packed into twenty-two on manoeuvres in Germany and rioting in Ulster. &#x2018;Too Cool for School&#x2019; was what we&#x2019;d been called by the smarmy gunner colonel on a course down in Warminster, congratulating through gritted teeth the boys who&#x2019;d picked up gallantry awards, too old now to win the spurs he never got the chance to while he was getting drunk on the Rhine and flying his desk. </p><p>But in a way he was right: what did we know just because we&#x2019;d had a few scraps in the desert? The bitter, loggy major who sat next to him had probably been to the Gulf back in &#x2019;91, when we were still learning to read; probably been patronized himself when he was a crow by returning Falklands vets who in turn had been instructed by grizzly old-timers sporting proud racks of World War Two medals, chests weighed down by Northwest Europe and Northern Desert Stars, which told of something greater than we could comprehend, the stuff of history imagined in black and white when no one was any- one without a Military Cross. Our grandfathers were heroes, whatever that meant, and they had taught the legends who charged up Mount Tumbledown in the Falklands and had returned to teach us. </p><p>We who didn&#x2019;t believe them. </p><p>We who had scoffed as we crawled up and down Welsh hills and pretended to scream as we stabbed sandbags on the bayonet assault course. We tried to resurrect the club at the start of our Afghan tour, lounging on canvas chairs on the gravel behind the tin huts of Camp Shorabak. Same sort of base, same sort of desert, just a few thousand miles the other side of Iran. By the end of the first month it was obvious that there would be no club. Each of us, wherever we were and if we could at all, would be reading alone. We went into battle in bandanas and shades with Penguin Clas- sics in our webbing, sketch pads in our daysacks and iPods on the radio, thinking we knew better than what had gone before. </p><p>In the end we did and, of course, we didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>Out in Helmand we were going to prove ourselves. </p><p>This was our moment, our <i>X Factor</i>&#x2014;winning, one perfect fucking moment; we finally had a war. From university through a year of training at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, from Sandhurst to the Balkans, from the Balkans to Iraq, and now from Iraq to Afghanistan, it felt as though our whole military lives had been building up to the challenge that Afghanistan presented. </p><p>The only problem was we were bored. </p><p>We landed in Kandahar with high hopes. The whole battalion, 600 men, mustard keen to get stuck into the unfamiliar and exciting task of working alongside the Afghan National Army (ANA) for seven months. A task which promised as much action and fulfilment as the last few years had failed to deliver. Of course, there was nothing exciting about arriving in an airfield in the middle of the night, but the taste of Mountain Dew the next morning was the taste of expeditionary warfare. </p><p>Yet those first March days of 2007, sitting on the boardwalk, acclimatizing outside the Korean takeaway, watching the many multinational uniforms amble towards the &#x2018;shops&#x2019; for souvenir carpets, we had to pinch ourselves to remember this was a war zone. The indeterminate South African accents of the military contractors mixed with the subcontinental singsong of the shit- jobs men jumping in and out of the ancient jingly wagons which rolled haphazardly past millions and millions of dollars&#x2019; worth of hardware while the Canadians played hockey on the improvised pitch, and I was bored. As bored as I&#x2019;d been when I decided to join the Army, as bored as I&#x2019;d been on public duties, guarding royal palaces while friends were guarding convoys in Iraq, as bored as I&#x2019;d been once we got to Iraq and found ourselves fighting the Senior Major more than Saddam. Stone-throwing, chain-smoking, soldier-purging bored. </p><p>Waiting for the onward staging to Camp Bastion, it was pretty easy to forget that Kandahar was already in the middle of nowhere. A shipping-container city where big swaggering joint headquarters with lots of flags sat side by side with puny National Support Element tents and the luxury of the semipermanent pods of the KBR contractors, who were the real power in places like this. All right, the Taliban weren&#x2019;t in the wire, but surely Kandahar was at least dangerous enough not to have a bunch of Canadians playing roller-hockey in the middle of its airfield. </p><p>Bored of the coffee shop at one end of the complex, we hopped on an ancient creaky bus, drove past the local market, where no doubt the Taliban&#x2019;s info gathering went on each Saturday as the RAF Regiment juicers bartered for fake DVDs, and hit another caf� 500 metres down the road. A sign by the bin, overflowing with empty <i>venti</i> coffee cups, announced that here six years ago the Taliban had fought their last stand. A worrying thought occurred: surely we weren&#x2019;t late again? </p><p>From Kandahar we decanted into Hercules transport aircraft for the jerky flight down to Camp Bastion, the tented sprawl in the middle of the &#x2018;Desert of Death&#x2019; that was the main British base in Helmand. There we conducted our reception staging and onward integration package under an oppressive and drizzling cloud. The mandatory and in equal measures dull and hilarious set of introduc tory briefs and exercises completed by all British soldiers entering an operational theatre was as vague as ever. All anyone wanted to know was: were we going to be shooting people? and: would we get in trouble if we did? The answers, to everyone&#x2019;s relief, were &#x2018;yes&#x2019; and &#x2018;no&#x2019;.</p><p>________________________________________</p><p>After days which seemed like weeks we arrived at Camp Shorabak, the ANA sister camp next door to Bastion. This would be our home base for the next seven months. The photos &#x2018;the Box&#x2019;&#x2014;the broad- shouldered commander of the Inkerman Company&#x2014;had taken on his recce had shown a horizon that symbolized everything Op Herrick (the umbrella name given to ongoing UK operations in Afghanistan) was going to be that previous tours hadn&#x2019;t been. The view shuffling at night to the loos down in Iraq had been depress ingly eloquent&#x2014;the burning fires of the Shaibah refinery and silhouetted pipelines told you all you needed to know about that war. The Hindu Kush, on the other hand, was the symbol of the great adventure, the danger and hardship that we hadn&#x2019;t endured last year. But a bubble of brown and grey cloud blocked out the sky the week we arrived, and we couldn&#x2019;t bloody see it. </p><p>To add insult to injury, it rained. At least in Iraq it had never rained. </p><p>The Marines we were taking over from didn&#x2019;t care. They were going home and had lost too many guys too close to the end of their gritty, six-month winter tour. Patience sapped by working with the Afghans we still hadn&#x2019;t met, they shamelessly crammed into the gym to work on their going-home bodies, laughing when we asked them questions about what it was like &#x2018;out there&#x2019;. </p><p>We were trying to get to grips with the theory of our task. A normal infantry battalion, the basic building block of any army, works in threes. The basic fighting unit in the British Army is an eight-man &#x2018;section&#x2019; (sub-divided into two four-man &#x2018;fire teams&#x2019;). There are three sections in a platoon&#x2014;each platoon headed up by</p><p>a young whippersnapper lieutenant or second-lieutenant and a wiser, grizzlier platoon sergeant&#x2014;and three platoons in a company&#x2014; each company led by a more experienced major and an even wiser and grizzlier company sergeant major. These three &#x2018;rifle compa- nies&#x2019; are the basic elements of a battalion, supported by a fourth company of specialized platoons (support company) and a large headquarters company which provides the logistic and planning support in the rear echelons. A tried and tested system forming up a happy family of nearly 700 fighting men, a system which we knew and trusted and which worked. </p><p>A system which, for the purposes of our job in Afghanistan, had been thrown out of the window. We were to be an Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (an OMLT), the set-up of which was simple, but bore no relation to anything we&#x2019;d ever done before. </p><p>Gone was the familiar comfort of the formations and tactics they&#x2019;d spoon-fed us at Sandhurst. Suddenly we found ourselves in much smaller companies of about thirty, the platoons reduced to mere six-man teams loaded with experience: captains and colour sergeants you would normally expect to find in more senior roles and the junior men all corporals and lance-sergeants who hadn&#x2019;t been the junior men for a few years. In these teams we were to attach ourselves to an ANA formation and mentor them as we both trained and fought together. Each six-man platoon would be responsible for an ANA company of 100, each company of thirty responsible, therefore, for a whole <i>kandak</i>&#x2014;an ANA battalion of 600 men&#x2014;with our own battalion commander no longer commanding his companies but sitting on the shoulder of the Afghan brigadier, advising him on how best to deploy his brigade of thou- sands. We would use our experience and expertise and superior </p><p>training and resources to form each Afghan battalion into a cred- ible fighting force. The potential for fun was incredible, the poten- tial for fuck-up immense. </p><p>So we should have been glad of the enforced lull at the start, should have been grateful for the time to get our heads around what everyone soon referred to as <i>omelette</i>. But, as weeks passed and the training continued and the cloud stayed down, what we were dreaming of was getting out there and having a fight. </p><p>________________________________________</p><p>The invite to my going-away party had promised &#x2018;The Great Game, Round III&#x2014;Beards, Bombs and Burkhas&#x2019;, but we were getting bollocked for not shaving before early-morning PT, and as for bombs, we fucking wished. It was only a matter of time before the creep ing bullshit would start; before those with nothing better to do would start to patrol the huts, complaining that the mosquito nets weren&#x2019;t in straight enough lines or that we should be carry- ing our weapons in the showers. The sergeants, infuriatingly tidy and unfailingly up at 0530, would crash around the hut and have us pining for the little eight-man tents we&#x2019;d resented back in Iraq. Like clockwork they would order &#x2018;lights-out&#x2019; at 2200, and the hut would become a profound dull tunnel lit by the blueish glow of lap- tops being watched on camp cots. Padding back from the show- ers, I&#x2019;d pick my way past rows of fluorescent faces, featureless and blurred through the mosi-nets, each man absorbed in the snug little world of the nylon domes, somehow finding a privacy in the headphones and pretending to sleep through the telltale rhythmic rustling of the cot next door. </p><p>The frustration grew when the Inkerman Company, luckybastards (In Iraq they&#x2019;d been <i>my</i> company), were crashed out in the middle of the night on a real-deal, this-is-not-a-drill, load-up-the-wagons tasking. As it turned out, they spent the next week bored and cold and with no sight of the enemy, but what was worrying was how selfishly and childishly jealous we all were. With nothing remotely gung-ho to boast of, we couldn&#x2019;t even be bothered to write home, and moodily sat out at nights on the Hesco fence, watching the thunderstorms. Towering clouds hurling mag nificent bolts of lightning silhouetting the mountains to the north drifted over our heads as we sulked and, in the finest tradition of bored soldiers, sat around throwing stones at each other. </p><p>The days ticked by. The heat and dust grew more oppressive, and the reports from elsewhere in Helmand grew more exciting, and our own boredom intensified with each passing day we didn&#x2019;t get out &#x2018;on the ground&#x2019;. Occasionally we would catch the whisper of something, the sniff of an American op going in to the north. But we were scheduled to spend the next two months training our <i>kandak</i> in camp. The idea of spending months trying to force Sandhurst on the ANA was unthinkable. Other companies started getting sent on real patrols and getting into real fights. Marlow was down on the Garmsir front line, and the daily SITREPs&#x2014; situation reports sent back from the boys on the ground&#x2014;were tantalizingly full of heavy engagements. The ANA soldiers, who had watched with amusement as we played our incomprehensible rugby sevens on the helipad, started to get bolshy, trying to play football right through our games. We were already telling our new comrades to piss off in their own country&#x2014;as someone shouted from the wing: how the fuck was it &#x2018;their&#x2019; helipad when their army had no helicopters? </p><p>They barely <i>had</i> an army. </p><p>________________________________________</p><p>205 Brigade of the 3rd (Hero) Corps of the Afghan National Army, though they didn&#x2019;t know it and though certainly not enough of us knew it, were the solution to Afghanistan. We were trotting out the right phrases&#x2014;&#x2018;An Afghan solution to an Afghan problem&#x2019;&#x2014; but we didn&#x2019;t believe them. Back with the Operational Training and Advisory Group (OPTAG) on pre-deployment exercises in Norfolk, we had asked one of the instructors what special prepa- ration we should undertake to be an OMLT, and he had made a gag about eggs. It wasn&#x2019;t OPTAG&#x2019;s fault, not that the training they delivered wasn&#x2019;t a waste of time. The problem was all in the name; &#x2018;mentoring&#x2019; and &#x2018;liaison&#x2019; sounded like holding hands and build- ing bridges. If we&#x2019;d wanted to build bridges we&#x2019;d have joined the Engineers; we were combat soldiers, a &#x2018;teeth&#x2019; arm, and our culture demanded more. If they&#x2019;d called the task OBFET (Operational Blow the Fuck out of Everything Team), then every battlegroup in the Army would have been creaming for it, but the Afghans might have objected. </p><p>Afghanistan was only going to work if the ANA could eventually do it for themselves. The Paras (Parachute Regiment), first out when the war began, had been thrust into a fight they couldn&#x2019;t win on their own and forgot about the ANA in the midst of keeping the Taliban from their throats. The only story anyone heard about the ANA during the whole of the first British deployment into what the papers soon exclusively referred to as &#x2018;the lawless Helmand Province&#x2019; was the one about how they ran away when Tim Illingworth of the Light Infantry won his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. The Marines had come in six months later with a whole lot more people and, in theory, a whole lot more sense. They dedicated almost a whole Command...</p></p><h2>Day the Cowboys Quit, The</h2><p>From one of the West's greatest living storytellers, winner of numerous awards, including the Golden Spur, the Saddleman, and the Western Heritage Award, here is Elmer Kelton's rousing novel of the Canadian River cowboy strike of 1883.<br><br>This was cowboy country once: a land of hardworking hands who rode for the brand come hell or high water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a different breed is moving in--big outfits backed by Eastern syndicates and run by power-hungry "managers," men who figure to make a profit, even if it means crowding a cowboy too far...<br><br>Hugh Hitchcock tried to keep the peace between rancher and cowboy, but when push came to shove the wagon boss knew where his loyalties lay.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when&nbsp;&nbsp;the ranchers stole his cattle, when they lynched his friend and hired a back shooter to put him in his grave, he kept on fighting...because even is they took everything he had, they couldn't touch his pride--or his willingness to fight to the bloody end.</p><p>Elmer Kelton is "one of the best of a new breed of Western writers who have driven the genre into new territory." -- <i>The New York Times</i><p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>.

Every 26,000 years, Earth lines up with the exact center of our galaxy. At 11:11 on December 21, 2012, this event happens again, and the ancient Maya calculated that it would mark the end, not only of this age, but of human consciousness as we know it.&nbsp;But what will actually happen? The end of the world? A new age for mankind? Nothing? The last time this happened, Cro-Magnon man suddenly began creating great art in the caves of southern France, which to this day remains one of the most inexplicable changes in human history. &nbsp;Now Whitley Strieber explores 2012 in a towering work of fiction that will astound readers with its truly new insights and a riveting roller-coaster ride&nbsp;of a story.&nbsp;A mysterious alien presence unexpectedly bursts out of sacred sites all over the world and begins to&nbsp;rip human souls from&nbsp;their bodies, plunging the world into chaos it has never before known. &nbsp;Courage meets cowardice, loyalty meets betrayal as an entire world struggles to survive this incredible end-all&nbsp;war. Heroes emerge, villains reveal themselves, and in the end something completely new and unexpected happens that at once lifts the fictional characters into a new life, and sounds a haunting real-world warning for the future.</p><p>WHITLEY STRIEBER&nbsp;is the author of over twenty novels and works of nonfiction among them <i>The Grays,</i> <i>The Wolfen,&nbsp;The Hunger, Communion, and The Coming Global Superstorm</i> (with Art Bell), which&nbsp;was the inspiration for the&nbsp;film <i>The Day After Tomorrow.</i>&nbsp;Chapter 1<br>General Alfred William North entered his superior officer&#x2019;s luxurious suite in the Pentagon. General Samson had been appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year, and had taken Al with him into the stratospheric world of high-level military politics.<br>General Samson&#x2019;s orderly had not been present to announce him. Given the present state of chaos within the military, that wasn&#x2019;t too surprising. He was probably on some detail or other within the vast building, and there hadn&#x2019;t been anybody available to spell him.<br>They were due at the White House in ten minutes, so Al didn&#x2019;t stand on ceremony. Knocking once, he entered the office. Al had met Tom Samson when he&#x2019;d been promoted to Air Force Chief of Staff. He&#x2019;d been a very efficient officer, and personable.<br>That, however, turned out to apply only to superior officers. Now that he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Al was still vice chairman, things had changed. Tom was a cold, charmless yeller, he was intolerant of failure, he was extremely demanding. Al still believed him to be a good officer, but his approach to the job was often too rigid. Truth to tell, Al had expected this promotion to be his. Counted on it, actually. What had happened had been a serious humiliation and a sad end to a great career. He had known the president for years, and he could not understand why he&#x2019;d chosen Tom over him, frankly. He&#x2019;d carried out his responsibilities with excellence.<br>The difference between the two of them was that Tom had served in fighters and Al had trained in them but served his entire career as a staff officer. Tom had a Purple Heart and an Air Medal. Did Al, who had never heard a shot fired in anger, envy Tom his participation in the Cuban Troubles?<br>Short answer: damn right. If it had been him, his career would not have stopped just short of the pinnacle.<br>&#x201c;Tom, I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; he said. Tentatively.<br>Silence.<br>The bathroom door was ajar, so Al walked toward it. &#x201c;Tom?&#x201d; he repeated.<br>There came a shuffle of sound from inside the bathroom.<br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Tom replied, an angry challenge in his rumble.<br>&#x201c;Tom, I&#x2019;m sorry, Lenny&#x2019;s not out front&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry!&#x201d;<br>As Al headed for the door, he noticed, open on Tom&#x2019;s desk, a silver box about the size of an old-fashioned cigarette case. Inside were six narrow golden cylinders. Lying beside them was a hypodermic, silver, that tapered seamlessly from a wide back with a socket in it that would obviously fit one of the cylinders, to a needle with a point so fine it almost appeared hairlike.<br>Al hurried out, his mind racing. That outfit&#x2014;was he an addict of some sort? A cancer victim? And what strange looking equipment.<br>A moment later, Tom slammed his office door with such force that the entire room shook.<br>Al hardly heard. If Tom was an addict, very frankly, that could be good. Worth knowing.<br>At that point, Lenny reappeared.<br>&#x201c;General, let me announce you,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;He knows I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br>Lenny went white. &#x201c;He does?&#x201d;<br>Al nodded. Nothing more was said, and a moment later Tom strode out, resplendent in his uniform, his gray eyes staring straight ahead, his face expressionless.<br>Lenny snapped to attention.<br>&#x201c;We need to talk,&#x201d; Tom snarled at him as he passed his desk.<br>&#x201c;Yessir!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You bet, yes sir, young fella.&#x201d; He went stomping off into the outer part of the suite.<br>Al followed him, and together they descended in his private elevator to the basement garage, where his staff car awaited them, rear door open. All of this was done in silence. In point of fact, you just plain did not talk to Tom unless he spoke first. He wasn&#x2019;t responsive to social chatter, jokes, gossip&#x2014;anything like that. In fact, the most amazing thing about him was that he held this most political of all military appointments. How the bastard had managed it, every single general on his staff would have loved to know&#x2014;if only to help find a way to hurt him.<br>Historically, the Joint Chiefs was a solid, smooth-running organization. Not under Tom. Tom had made it into a rat&#x2019;s nest full of spider webs. Men who had worked together for years now fought like what they were&#x2014;creatures in a trap.<br>In the year since Tom had come, there had been five &#x201c;resignations.&#x201d; All, in fact, firings, brutal, mean spirited, often mysterious. Worse, they had been followed by vindictive little appointments to posts designed to humiliate the victims. General Halff had been Army Chief of Staff. He was now serving out his time as commander of Fort Silker in Mississippi. Fort Silker was being decommissioned, so Harry&#x2019;s basic job was to arrange for environmental cleanup and the sale of assets.<br>Al settled into the car. He knew that this meeting was important, but he wasn&#x2019;t quite sure what it was about. He supposed that Tom knew, but Tom wasn&#x2019;t saying. Perhaps Al was on the chopping block. Perhaps Al was due to be caught unprepared in front of the president, a certain prelude to destruction.<br>Except for one thing: Al had known James Hannah Wade since they were roomies at the Academy. In recent years, the friendship had necessarily become arm&#x2019;s-length, but the two men were still close enough that Jimmy would on occasion invite Al to hammer squash balls with him. This usually happened when the going in this very difficult presidency got really rough. But Jimmy was flying high right now, so no squash with his old friend. And, as both of them knew, betrayed friend.<br>The car turned onto Fourteenth Street, headed past the familiar emerald arches of a McDonald&#x2019;s, then entered the White House grounds.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re listening today,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;An intelligence report.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the general area, sir?&#x201d;<br>Tom turned toward him, then turned back again. A moment later, the car stopped, and they were walking through the White House to the Cabinet Room&#x2014;but then they passed the Cabinet Room and the Oval and headed through Deputy Chief of Staff Morrisey&#x2019;s office into the Presidential Study.<br>It was an improbable place for a large meeting&#x2014;except that it wasn&#x2019;t a large meeting.<br>&#x201c;Hi, Al,&#x201d; the president said. Al could feel Tom stiffen. Good sign, maybe the president had finally realized that the appointment had been the mistake that Al had told him it was&#x2014;practically the only political thought he&#x2019;d ever shared with him. He turned to Tom. &#x201c;Good morning, General.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good morning, Mr. President.&#x201d;<br>A moment later, National Intelligence Chief Bo Waldo came in, followed by two aides, who proceeded to hover over the TV.<br>Waldo spoke. &#x201c;Yesterday, there was a massive explosion in Cairo that resulted in at least a hundred thousand deaths and property damage on an extraordinary scale. The explosion destroyed the Pyramid of Cheops.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; Tom snapped.<br>The president gave him a sharp look.<br>But his impatience was understandable. The Cairo disaster was on every news channel in the world. You couldn&#x2019;t find anything else on TV, radio, the Internet&#x2014;you name it. Al thought, they know the terrorist group responsible, and they&#x2019;re about to inform us that the Brits are going in with a hit. We were being asked to provide some sort of support, no doubt, and the problem with this kind of thing was always the same: how did you do what one empire wanted without angering another?<br>Waldo cleared his throat. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t had another one in half an hour, Mr. President,&#x201d; he said.<br>Al&#x2019;s mind whirled. Another one? What was he saying, here?<br>&#x201c;How many are there, at this point?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Including the one that just came up in Cambodia, that would be fourteen.&#x201d;<br>Al wanted to ask what in the world they were talking about, but he couldn&#x2019;t without revealing his ignorance. Tom&#x2019;s glare showed that he was thinking along exactly the same lines. The Joint Chiefs controlled no fewer than five uniformed intelligence services, in addition to the Philippines Colonial Agency and the Cuban Intelligence Corps, so how was it that they hadn&#x2019;t been briefed by their own people? Tom would want that looked at, and for once Al would be in total agreement with him. It was an inexcusable lapse.<br>The president said, &#x201c;And they&#x2019;re all&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the same? Distance, all that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Each one is exactly six thousand two hundred twenty miles from an axis point eleven hundred miles from the north pole. They&#x2019;ve all appeared in the middle of ancient ruins. The Institut Indo-Chinois de Culture has already started testing the one in Preah Vihear. Thus far, it has a hardness number of at least three thousand, just like Cairo. Clearly, the same substance, and by far the hardest thing on earth. The only weapon that might affect these objects would be a hydrogen bomb.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do we have any of those?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We do, Sir,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;Well hidden from Royal Air Force mandatory inspections, but we do.&#x201d;<br>The Brits were rigorous enforcers of the Non-Nuclear Pact between the five empires, of which the U.S. was the smallest and the most lightly armed&#x2014;and therefore the only one that actually needed to obey the damned pact. Certainly, the French didn&#x2019;t. And as far as the Czar was concerned or the secretive Japanese Emperor, who knew what they might be doing in their hidden lairs? There might even be a Chinese warlord with a nuke of some sort.<br>The president went to the window. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve worried about one coming up here in Washington. Should I?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Unless there&#x2019;s another phase,&#x201d; Waldo responded, &#x201c;this thing has the look of being completed. But you know, of course, what&#x2019;s odd&#x2014;every single location was an ancient sacred site.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So they knew,&#x201d; the president said, turning suddenly, staring first at one of them and then another.<br>Al saw a plea in his eye, as if the American people were there, pleading through him for knowledge.<br>&#x201c;Lenses,&#x201d; Al said. Tom gave him a sharp look, but he continued. &#x201c;Lenses reflect and they refract. Do we have any idea which it is that these are supposed to do?&#x201d;<br>Waldo shook his head. &#x201c;So far, they&#x2019;re simply there. According to MI-3, the one in Cairo isn&#x2019;t emitting or absorbing any known energy. The Institut says the same about the one in Cambodia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Any idea if they&#x2019;re natural, then?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re natural, Mr. President.&#x201d; Waldo replied.<br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a good question,&#x201d; Al said. &#x201c;If they&#x2019;re manmade, who constructed them and why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That is an urgent question,&#x201d; President Wade snapped. &#x201c;Possibly the most urgent question in the history of the world.&#x201d; He looked from one of them to the other. &#x201c;You seem unimpressed, Tom.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sir, if we don&#x2019;t know anything about them, how can we make that assessment?&#x201d;<br>The president stiffened. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s instinct, goddamn it!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else you need to see,&#x201d; Waldo said hurriedly. &#x201c;Roll the imagery, please.&#x201d;<br>The TV screen flickered, came to life. Al saw people walking through a rather pretty countryside. They were dressed oddly, some in nightclothes, others in underwear, one or two in coats, one completely naked. There were men, women, and children.<br>The group was being followed by green and white checked police cars, with their blue light bars flickering.<br>&#x201c;What are we looking at, here?&#x201d; President Wade asked.<br>&#x201c;This is in Gloucestershire,&#x201d; Waldo said.<br>&#x201c;Shot when?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s live,&#x201d; Waldo replied. &#x201c;During the night, these people were struck by a bright light that emanated from objects overhead that were disk-shaped in structure. They&#x2019;ve been walking due north ever since. They&#x2019;ve come fourteen miles in eleven hours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are these things related to the disks we&#x2019;ve been seeing for years? The ones NASA claims are intelligently controlled?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know. We really don&#x2019;t know much of anything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bottom line, though, these people can&#x2019;t be stopped, am I right?&#x201d; Tom asked, his voice full of sarcasm.<br>&#x201c;They cannot be stopped, General Samson,&#x201d; Waldo snapped back. &#x201c;They can be demobilized only by being drugged. An examination of one of them completed at a hospital in the area showed a normal physical specimen. But a brain scan revealed a different picture. The brain function was about a third normal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve lost something, then,&#x201d; Tom responded. &#x201c;Their intelligence?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Waldo replied.<br>&#x201c;Do we have any imagery of the attack?&#x201d; the president asked.<br>&#x201c;Witnesses report disks glowing dull orange.&#x201d;<br>Al had a thought. &#x201c;Where is the nearest lens, in relation to Gloucestershire?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What relevance does that have?&#x201d; Tom asked. &#x201c;If I may be so bold, General?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s a good question,&#x201d; Waldo replied, &#x201c;and the answer is, the nearest lens in the Tassili Desert in Algeria. And what I was about to add is that there&#x2019;s a Foreign Legion report that a burst of orange fireballs was emitted from the lens there. But the event took place just four minutes before the Gloucestershire attack, so&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re related,&#x201d; Al said. Instantly, he regretted it. He&#x2019;d spoken in haste.<br>&#x201c;General, I fail to see&#x2014;&#x201d; Tom began.<br>The president interrupted him. &#x201c;I agree. Whether the things that struck in Gloucestershire came out of the lens in Algeria, God only knows. But there is obviously a relationship of some kind between all of these things&#x2014;the disks we&#x2019;ve been seeing for fifty years, the ones that attacked those people, and the lenses, and I might add that I think we need to assume the worst, here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All I see are British and French problems,&#x201d; Samson said. &#x201c;Unless some of these things are in the Japanese Empire. Are they?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, so far only British and French imperial territory is involved, and some South American countries.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I say we wait,&#x201d; Tom announced, his voice taking on the tone of the pulpit. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s some kind of a secret weapon. Nothing to do with us. The Czar&#x2019;s supposed to have some doozies, and he wants African possessions. He&#x2019;d like Egypt, in fact, to annoy the Turks, if nothing else.&#x201d;<br>The president turned on him. &#x201c;Why are you here, Tom? Why in hell do you think you&#x2019;re here? Something is wrong. Goddamn wrong.&#x201d; He gestured at the screen. &#x201c;This will spread, you know.&#x201d;<br>Tom held his ground. &#x201c;We have no evidence of that, Sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It will spread!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an attack on the United States. And there&#x2019;s no evidence that such an attack is imminent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tom,&#x201d; the president responded, &#x201c;as soon as you get back to your office, you are to go to DEFCON 1 and issue a War Warning to all commands, worldwide.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sir, I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re under attack, you damn fool,&#x201d; the president said. &#x201c;The blue, white, and red, damn you! Not just a couple of the empires and a few banana kingdoms. Us!&#x201d;<br>Tom went stiff. His eyes seemed literally to glitter with murderous rage.<br>But the president wasn&#x2019;t finished. &#x201c;Gentlemen, I&#x2019;ve got a military background, and I know when my enemy is probing my defenses. That&#x2019;s what happened in that little town in the very heart of the most powerful empire on earth.

The Emancipation Proclamation&#x2014;one of the sacred icons of American history&#x2014;a tragedy? <i>How can this be?</i> That was the opinion of Frederick Douglass, the most important African American leader of the 19th century, who proclaimed, &#x201c;I denounce the so-called Emancipation.&#x201d; Douglass wrote: &#x201c;I admit that the Negro...has made little progress from barbarism to civilization, and that he is in a deplorable condition since his emancipation. That he is worse off in many respects, than when he was a slave, I am compelled to admit...&#x201d; Indeed, social statistics of 1900 indicate that material quality of life was lower for most black Americans than under slavery. Kirkpatrick Sale marshals much forgotten evidence to cast this glorious part of American history in a realistic and critical light. Emancipation, yes. But as a military measure during a cruel war of invasion? Slavery once existed throughout the Western Hemisphere, but almost everywhere except the United States, it ended peacefully. Emancipation with no thought or plan for the unprecedented situation to be managed? With no real sympathy or interest in the people freed except their usefulness in controlling and exploiting the conquered South? (Some Northern leaders denounced the Proclamation as an atrocity and an estimated 200,000 Northerners deserted or evaded service in a war for African Americans rather than for the &#x201c;Union.&#x201d;) Perhaps never in history, Kirkpatrick Sale demonstrates, has a benevolent act been so tainted with impure motives and disdain of consequences. Abraham Lincoln has a lot to answer for, says the author. His flawed proclamation doomed Americans to a century and a half of racial conflict and disparity that is still with us.

For the reader, the delight of McNally's cases lies less in the plot than in the Dickensian characters he encounters (and beds), his banter with them, and his comments on them. All these are amplified through the sensibility of Adam Henderson. Not at all suave, he has a fey, untrained sound. And yet, by virtue of his own puckish touch, expressiveness, and verve, he gives a particularly satisfying rendition. He takes a while to get used to, but the patience pays off.

So says Logan Mountstuart, the hero of William Boyd&#39;s eighth novel. ANY HUMAN HEART tells the story of Mountstuart&#39;s long and rackety life, one which spans the twentieth century, in all its fantastic and humdrum, dangerous and tranquil, tragic and humourous aspects. ANY HUMAN HEART is an ambitious, all-encompassing novel. Through the intimate journals of Logan Mounstuart we travel from Uruguay to Oxford, on to Paris, the Bahamas, New York and West Africa, and meet his three wives, his family, his friends and colleagues, his rivals, enemies and lovers, including notables such as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Ernest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf.</p><p>Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel <i>Any Human Heart</i> is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling "my personal rollercoaster"--or rather, "not so much a rollercoaster", but a yo-yo, "a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child." From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism and abject poverty. <p> Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere author William Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall <i>Any Human Heart</i> is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. <i>--Alan Stewart</i>, Amazon.co.uk</p><b>Praise from England for <i>Any Human Heart<br></i></b><i><br></i>"A work of astonishing ventriloquistic virtuosity . . . A brilliant evocation of a past era . . . One finds oneself almost reading the journals as genuine . . . which is quite a feat, because Boyd has skillfully mimicked the artless and random qualities of every diary."<br>- Caroline Moore, <i>Sunday Telegraph<br><br></i>"A book full of delights . . . No one is better than William Boyd at drawing the reader into [a] tale from the very first sentence."<br>- Erica Wagner, <i>The Times<br><br></i>"An excellent picaresque novel, written in a confident, easy-going style . . . <i>Any Human Heart</i> is an old-fashioned, new-fangled tour de force which maintains its brio to the very end. An obvious contender for the next round of literary prizes, it would be considered a worthy and genuinely popular winner of any one of them."<br>- Anita Brookner,<i> The Spectator<br><br></i>"Boyd's terrific powers of storytelling are given free rein here: this is a biography where you don't know the ending, and he keeps you glued and guessing . . . One of Boyd's most enjoyable novels to date: generous, witty and sneakily profound."<br>- Catherine Shoard, <i>Evening Standard<br><br></i>"Compelling . . . An addictively enjoyable read as well as a testament to the endurance of the human heart."<br>- Geordie Grieg, <i>Literary Review<br><br></i>"Astounding. . .The most sincere measure of praise one can attach to William Boyd's new novel is that it ranks alongside <i>The New Confessions</i> as one of his great achievements . . . It also resembles the earlier book in its ambition and spirit, being an account of tumultuous tragicomic life that lasts from one end of the twentieth century to the other. To pull off that trick once is considerable: to do it twice is astounding." <br>&#x2013; Anthony Quinn, <i>The Mail on Sunday<br><br></i></p><h2>The Meaning of Independence: John Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson</h2><p><p>Americans did not at first cherish the idea of political severance from their mother country. In just a few years, however, they came to desire indepen-dence above all else. What brought about this change of feeling and how did it affect the lives of their citizens? To answer these questions, Edmund S. Morgan looks at three men who may fairly be called the "architects of independence," the first presidents of the United States. Anecdotes from their letters and diaries recapture the sense of close identity many early Americans felt with their country&#x2019;s political struggles. Through this perspective, Morgan examines the growth of independence from its initial declaration and discovers something of its meaning, for three men who responded to its challenge and for the nation that they helped create.</p><p><i>The Meaning of Independence,</i> first published in 1976, has become one of the standard short works on the first three presidents of the United States&#x2015;George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. When the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x2019; Association and the Organization of American Historians asked 1,500 historians to name the ten best books about George Washington, this book was one of those selected. In this updated edition, the author provides a new preface to address a few remaining concerns he has pondered in the quarter century since first publication.</p><p>Tag:A classic work on the founding by the author of the bestselling Benjamin Franklin</p></p><p><p>Edmund S.

Infants are able to estimate and calculate even before they learn the words for numbers. How have we come to possess this talent for numbers? In <i>A Brain for Numbers</i>, Andreas Nieder explains how our brains process numbers. He reports that numerical competency is deeply rooted in our biological ancestry; it can be traced through both the evolution of our species and the development of our individual minds. It is not, as it has been traditionally explained, based on our ability to use language. We owe our symbolic mathematical skills to the nonsymbolic numerical abilities that we inherited from our ancestors. The principles of mathematics, Nieder tells us, are reflections of the innate dispositions wired into the brain.</p><p>Nieder explores how the workings of the brain give rise to numerical competence, tracing flair for numbers to dedicated &#x201c;number neurons&#x201d; in the brain. Drawing on a range of methods including brain imaging techniques, behavioral experiments, and twin studies, he outlines a new, integrated understanding of the talent for numbers. Along the way, he compares the numerical capabilities of humans and animals, and discusses the benefits animals reap from such a capability. He shows how the neurobiological roots of the brain's nonverbal quantification capacity are the evolutionary foundation of more elaborate numerical skills. He discusses how number signs and symbols are represented in the brain; calculation capability and the &#x201c;neuromythology&#x201d; of mathematical genius; the &#x201c;start-up tools&#x201d; for counting and developmental of dyscalculia (a number disorder analogous to the reading disorder dyslexia); and how the brain processes the abstract concept of zero.</p></p><p>Andreas Nieder is Professor of Animal Physiology and Director of the Institute of Neurobiology at the University of T�bingen.<p><i>A Brain for Numbers&nbsp;</i>teaches so much about the history and the study of number sense in all kinds of animal life from insects to birds to primates including humans. The various research approaches are fascinating, especially the use of statistical classifiers in analyzing the fMRI data. I loved this book from beginning to end.</p>&#x2015;<b>Maria M.

Against a backdrop of changing attitudes toward wartime memories and a gradual resurgence of interest in the war, Hammer offers extensive evidence of Bacon&#x2019;s use of prewar Nazi propaganda photography as a springboard for painting. By exploring some of Bacon&#x2019;s best-known and most compelling works, Hammer illuminates the artist&#x2019;s aim to transmute challenging photographic sources into a reflection on the contemporary world.</p><p><b>Martin Hammer</b> is a curator and reader in history of art at the University of Edinburgh.</p><h2>Character and Influence of the Indian Trade in Wisconsin: A Study of the Trading Post as an Institution</h2><p>Turner discusses the trading post as a frontier institution within the narrower context of the Wisconsin fur trade.

At once comic and tragic, grotesque and beautiful, the series of 64 images features his wife, Madelyn, in a hag's Halloween mask together in each with a different friend or relative in a transparent mask. Original copies of this small but seminal work now sell for upwards of $500. Critic and scholar James Rhem has worked closely with the archives in the photographer's estate, as well as directly with his surviving family members to reconstruct Meatyard's original, and unrealized, intentions for the publication of this project. As a result, this revised edition features the correct sequencing of images and, most importantly, the missing captions, which, in accordance with Meatyard's instructions, are reproduced in his own handwriting as white type knocked out of a black background. In addition, each surviving participant in the Lucybelle Crater project has been interviewed by Rhem, and the book includes a critical essay and extensive background information. Accompanying the Album are 40 more figurative works establishing a context for it and exploring important themes in Meatyard's work. This is an important rediscovery in the history of American photography.</p><p>Ralph Eugene Meatyard was born in 1925 and lived in Lexington, Kentucky, where he was part of a circle that included the likes of Thomas Merton, Guy Davenport, and Jonathan Williams.

In refreshingly readable prose, Ms. Reis presents eleven essays on debated cruxes of the Hebrew Bible, all of which have been published in serious academic journals despite the author's lack of traditional credentials.<br>Using everyday analogies and paradigms drawn from contemporary life, and infusing her approach with references to literary figures from Cervantes to Edmund Wilson to Ring Lardner, Reis's analyses display originality and unpretentious intellect. Her compelling opinions and down-to-earth approach will show lay readers that the Bible is neither too hard nor too far away and will oblige scholars to approach their own interpretations with more rigorous attention to every word.</p><p>Pamela Tamarkin Reis is an independent student of the Bible and lives in Branford, Connecticut. Her original literary interpretations of debated biblical passages have achieved publication in such scholarly journals as Bible Review, The Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, Prooftexts, The Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society, Judaism, and Vetus Testamentum, although she has no academic affiliation or credentials. She has delivered papers before professional audiences at the annual national conferences of the Society of Biblical Literature and the Association of Jewish Studies and has presented her unconventional close readings at religious institutions as well as to college classes."Bold and cantankerous, fresh and lively . . . [Reis] is not afraid to tip the sacred cows, . . ." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"For those readers . . . dissatisfied with the deconstructions and reconstructions of the higher criticism, but uneasy with traditional apologetics . . ." -- <i>William W. Hallo, The William M. Laffan Professor of Assyriology and Babylonian Literature, Yale University</i><br><br>"Pamela Tamarkin Reis guides the reader through a series of biblical stories, with expert analysis, in elegant yet simple prose." -- <i>Gary A. Rendsburg, Paul and Berthe Hendrix Memorial Professor of Jewish Studies, Cornell University</i><br><br>"This book is a pure delight! Pamela Tamarkin Reis guides the reader through a series of biblical stories, with expert analysis, in elegant yet simple prose, devoid of scholarly jargon, and with personal aplomb. Her lively and original interpretations are exemplars of literary exegesis. And there is a bonus: the prefatory comments to each chapter detail Ms. Reis's approach to the Bible, describe her odyssey through the maze of biblical research, and tell how she arrived at her interpretations--what she was doing when such and such thought occurred to her, what she was reading when, how she went to the library to look up a source, which took her to another source, and so on. These are not the usual thoughts that one encounters in scholarly writing and in literary analysis, but they add immensely to the present work, allowing the reader to trace the genesis and development of an independent idea and to see the mind of the scholar at work."--Gary A. Rendsburg, Paul and Berthe Hendrix Memorial Professor of Jewish Studies, Cornell University<p>"Some readers may be drawn to this title by the novelty associated with its authorship: Tamarkin is a first-time author at the age of 67 and not a professional in religious studies. Nevertheless, she is a sincere student of the Hebrew Bible, and her thoughtful essays compare well to any professional work being done in the field now. Her 'fresh look' consists of applying common sense, in addition to fashionable methodologies, to the creation stories, the story of Hagar, and other tales and traditions of the Hebrew Bible. Tamarkin's reasoning is consistently intriguing, and she writes with great effectiveness and charm. Highly recommended, especially where scholarly interest in Hebrew and Christian Scriptures is strong."<br><i>--Library Journal</i></p><p>"Bold and cantankerous, fresh and lively...[Reis] is not afraid to tip the sacred cows,...arguing...for more literary cohesion in the Hebrew Bible than most scholars have allowed.

As president of the World Conservation Union and the only person to have served on all five independent international commissions on global issues, Shridath Ramphal brings to his study a unique perspective and deep understanding of both development and the environment.</p></p><p><p>Sir Shridath Ramphal is a former minister of Guyana and was secretary-general of the fifty-nation Commonwealth 1975-1990. He was a member of all the major international commissions that reported in the 1980s, including the Brandt Commission on Environment and Development. Formally president of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and chairman of a commission looking into the future of the West Indies, he brings to his writing the views of a lifelong internationalist informed by the perspectives of developing nations. </p><p></p><p></p>This book addresses the question: "If the development of the quarter of the world's people who are now rich has brought us all so close to the limits of sustainable living on Earth, how is the development of the three-quarters who are poor to be accommodated?" For Ramphal, president of the World Conservation Union and a native of Guyana, that challenge is more than academic--it is a matter of ethics, of maintaining a decent quality of living for people in developed countries, of ensuring that people in developing countries have opportunities for economic growth. Among the topics he covers are global warming, ozone depletion, fossil fuel consumption, deforestation, water contamination, biodiversity, and disposal of nuclear materials. Ramphal incorporates scientific information from many sources to underscore a correlative theme, that developed countries must lower their own natural resource consumption levels while enabling developing countries to achieve higher growth levels. His explanations of the physical bases of current environmental problems are easily accessible to all readers.

Discovering the identity of this irresistible warrior will complicate Sadie's search for a legendary gold mine. For he is Morgan MacKeage, a medieval highlander in modern-day Maine, a man with the fury of the untamed wilderness pounding in his veins -- and the power to unlock Sadie's fragile heart.</p></p><p>A native of rural central Maine, Janet Chapman lives there in a cozy log cabin on a lake with her husband.&nbsp; Three cats and a stray young bull moose keep them company.&nbsp; The author of the hugely popular Highlander time-travel series, she also writes contemporary romances.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>Present day, deep in the Maine woods<br><br><i>The old wizard sat in reflective silence</i> on the tall granite cliff, oblivious to the awakening forest around him, the roaring waterfall that shot from the precipice, and the churning pool of frothing water a good hundred feet beneath where he sat. Daar scratched his beard with the butt of his cane and sighed, his troubling thoughts completely focused on the lone fisherman below. He had done a terrible disservice to that young man six years ago. Aye, he was solely responsible for turning Morgan MacKeage's life into the mess it was now.<br><br>Daar had cast a spell that had brought Morgan's laird and brother, Greylen MacKeage, forward to the twenty-first century. It had been the wizard's greatest blunder to date. Oh, Greylen had made the journey safely enough, but so had six of his enemies, two of his men, and his younger brother, Morgan. Even their disgruntled war horses had managed to get sucked into the spell, catapulting them all on an unimaginable journey forward through time.<br><br>Daar blamed the mishap on his advanced age. He was old and tired, a bit forgetful on occasion, and that was the reason his magic sometimes went awry.<br><br>Morgan MacKeage should have been eight hundred years dead, having had the joy of a couple of wives and a dozen or so kids. Instead, the Highland warrior fishing below was now thirty-two, still unwed, and lonely. It seemed nearly a sin to Daar that his wizard's ineptness had caused such a fine, strong, intelligent warrior to be cast adrift without direction or purpose.<br><br>Daar hunched his shoulders under the weight of his guilt. Aye, that young man's malaise was all his fault, and it was past time he fixed things.<br><br>A woman might help.<br><br>Then again, a woman might only add to the young warrior's troubles.<br><br>Daar had discovered that twenty-first-century females were a decidedly peculiar breed. They were brash, outspoken, opinionated, and stubborn. But mostly they were simply too damned independent. They dared to live alone, they worked to support themselves, and they quite often owned property and held positions of power in business and government.<br><br>How was a man born in a time when women were chattel supposed to deal with such independent women? How was a virile twelfth-century warrior supposed to embrace his new life in such an outrageous time?<br><br>The MacKeages had lived in this modern world for six years. Six years of adapting, evolving, and finally accepting, and still Morgan MacKeage stood alone. Morgan's brother, Greylen, was happily settled with a wife, a daughter, and twins on the way. Callum was courting a woman in town, and Ian was secretly seeing a widow two nights a week. Even their sole surviving enemy, Michael MacBain, had fathered a son and was getting on with his life.<br><br>Only Morgan remained detached, not only from the company of females but also from the passions of life itself. He hunted, fished, and walked the woods incessantly, as if searching for something to settle the ache in his gut.<br><br>"Give a care, old man, lest you fall and become feed for the fish."<br><br>Daar nearly did fall at the sound of Morgan's familiar voice behind him. He stood and faced the young warrior and gave him a fierce scowl.<br><br>"You're a pagan, Morgan MacKeage, for scaring ten years off an old priest's life."<br><br>Morgan lifted a brow. "When I next see a priest, I'll be sure to confess my sin."<br><br>Daar attempted to straighten his shoulders and puff his chest at the insult but gave up as soon as he realized it made little difference. "You're seeing a priest now."<br><br>Morgan lifted his other brow. "What church ordains a <i>dr�idh</i> into its ranks?"<br><br>"I was a priest long before I became a wizard," Daar shot back, pointing at the warrior. "And one is not contradictory to the other. Both roads lead in the same direction."<br><br>Morgan merely chuckled as he turned and started up the path that led to Daar's cabin. "Come on, old man, if you want breakfast," he said without looking back.<br><br>Eyeing the string of trout swinging from Morgan's belt, Daar decided he'd school the warrior on his manners later. After all, this argument had been repeated often over the last two years, since Daar had been forced to reveal his wizard's identity in order to save Greylen MacKeage's wife from kidnappers.<br><br>And what thanks had he got? None. Not even an "I'm sorry" that his precious old staff had been cut in half and thrown into a high mountain pond. It was that same pond, by the way, that was the source of the waterfall shooting out the side of the cliff from an underground stream, creating the crystal-clear pool that had produced the tasty trout he was about to have for breakfast.<br><br>"Does that puny new cane have any real power yet, <i>dr�idh?"</i> Morgan asked as he settled into a comfortable, unhurried pace toward Daar's cabin.<br><br>Daar snorted. "As if I'd tell you," he muttered, eyeing the leather-sheathed sword tied to Morgan's backpack. The sword was more than three feet long, extending from Morgan's waist to a foot above his head, the hilt cocked to the side for easy access. That sword was as large as Greylen's sword and just as capable of destroying Daar's new cane.<br><br>Morgan stopped and turned to help Daar over a fallen log in the path. "Can it even toast bread yet?" he asked.<br><br>"It's powerful enough to gather stars in your head if I smack you with it."<br><br>Apparently not worried by the threat, Morgan turned his attention to something he pulled from his pocket. "What do you know of these?" he asked, holding up a three-foot-long orange ribbon of plastic.<br><br>Daar squinted at the ribbon. "What is it?"<br><br>"I don't know." Morgan leaned his fishing pole against his chest and used both hands to stretch the ribbon to its full length to show off the writing on it. "I found this one and several like it tied to trees all over the valley. And each one has numbers written on it."<br><br>Daar dismissed the ribbon with a negligent wave, eyeing the trout instead. His stomach rumbled, loudly announcing his hunger. "It's probably surveyors marking ownership lines," he said. He started toward home again. He was hungry, dammit, and had no patience for puzzles right now. "That's what they do in these modern times to mark their lands," Daar continued. "A man's word that he owns up to a river or to the crest of a mountain is no longer enough."<br><br>Daar stopped when he realized Morgan was not following. "Hell, boy. Your own land has lines drawn on a map and marked in the woods. They're even written in the deed you got when your brother purchased TarStone Mountain. It's what makes things legal today."<br><br>"They're not borders," Morgan said, stuffing the ribbon back in his pocket as he moved to follow Daar. "They don't run in any line I can discern."<br><br>ard"Then maybe they're logging markers," Daar offered next, mentally planning what he would fix with the trout. He started scanning the forest floor as they walked, looking for edible mushrooms. "Maybe they're doing a cutting in the valley," he absently continued. "Those numbers could be directions for the cutters."<br><br>"No. I found some of the ribbons on MacKeage land," Morgan countered, moving ahead to block his path, forcing them to a halt yet again. "And we are not cutting trees in this valley. The loggers we've hired are working east of here."<br><br>Daar looked up into Morgan's intense green eyes. "What is it you're wanting that's so important you're letting a fine brace of trout grow old?"<br><br>"I want you to use your magic and tell me what's happening in my woods."<br><br>Daar lifted his cane and used it to scratch his beard. "Ah. So it's okay to cast spells when it's convenient for you but not me? Is that how it works now?"<br><br>Morgan's eyes darkened. "There are rumors of a park being built in this valley, and I want to know if they're getting ahead of themselves and presuming to start work."<br><br>"And if they are, what does it matter?"<br><br>"I don't want the park to be here. A quarter of this valley is MacKeage land, and I'm against selling any of it."<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"It's ours."<br><br>Daar lost hope that he was going to get breakfast anytime soon, unless they simply built a fire here and roasted the trout on spits. He sat down on a stump, cupped his hands over the top burl of his cane, and stared up at the young warrior.<br><br>"What's a few thousand acres to you, when your clan already owns four hundred thousand?"<br><br>"They can build their park someplace else, as long as it's not near this gorge."<br><br>Daar finally got his mind off his belly and focused on the man standing in front of him. Was that a faint spark he saw in those usually indifferent spruce-green eyes? Had something in this forest finally captured the attention of Morgan MacKeage?<br><br>"What's so special about this particular gorge?"<br><br>Morgan unhooked the trout from his belt. "These," he said, holding them up. He waved his fishing pole to encompass the forest. "This entire ridge. The stream that mysteriously appears from nowhere out the side of the mountain, cutting this gorge down to the valley. These trees. Have you even noticed their size, old man? Or their health? And these fish," he said again, shaking them slightly. "They're brook trout the size of salmon."<br><br>Daar frowned as he slowly looked around the forest. Aye, the trees did seem rather overlarge when compared with the others of the area. "They are big," he admitted. "I never noticed that before."<br><br>"That's because they were just like the rest only two years ago."<br><br>That number pricked at the wizard's memory.<br><br>"It's when your staff was thrown into the pond," Morgan continued at Daar's look of confusion. "It's the mist," he added, waving his fishing pole again. "See? It boils up from the falls and covers this gorge."<br><br>Daar nearly fell off the stump he was sitting on. The mist from the stream that ran from the mountain pond where his old staff lay?<br><br>Well, hell. Daar knew the water was special in that pond, since it held his magical staff, but he had never stopped to consider consequences such as this. Huge fish? Towering trees? A veritable rain forest where none should exist.<br><br>"It's magic," Morgan said in a whispered, almost reverent voice. "This entire gorge is the result of what happened two years ago. And I don't want it to become part of a park. Hundreds of people will come hiking through here and discover the magic."<br><br>Daar stood up. "And neither do I," he quickly agreed. "We must do something about this."<br><br>"You've got to talk to Grey," Morgan said. "And make him understand that our land must not become part of this park."<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>"He'll listen to you."<br><br>"He will not. He's mad at me right now. His wife just had some test for her pregnancy, and the blasted doctor told Grey that Grace was carrying twin daughters, not sons."<br><br>Morgan looked startled. "They can tell if an unborn child is a boy or a girl?"<br><br>Daar shrugged. "It seems they can now." He started walking back the way they had come, totally resigned now to missing his breakfast. He chose a path that would lead them above the falls to a ridge that overlooked the valley below. "Come on. Let's go see just how strong my staff has grown."<br><br>Morgan quickly fell into step beside him. "Will it tell me what the plastic ribbons are for?" he asked.<br><br>"Nay. It's not a crystal ball. It's only a conductor of energy."<br><br>As they walked along the path, Daar fingered the smooth, delicate cane he had been training since his had been lost. It sported only a couple of burls so far, which indicated that its power was not yet strong. His old staff, the one Grey had severed with his sword and thrown into the pond, had been riddled with burls, carrying the strength of fourteen hundred years of concentrated energy.<br><br>"Then what's the point?" Morgan asked. "If it can't do anything yet, why are we climbing the ridge?"<br><br>"Hush. I'm trying to remember the words," Daar instructed as they walked along. It was not that easy, reciting spells by rote. The last time he had tested the new cane for something more intricate than lighting a fire, it had rained dung beetles for more than an hour. He could only thank God that it had been dark outside at the time.<br><br>Surprisingly, Morgan obeyed his request, and they quickly reached the top of Fireline Ridge. Two miles behind them was the pond where his old staff lay on the bottom, and in front of them was the deep gorge that fingered its way to the vast valley below.<br><br>Daar was stunned. From this vantage point the stream's path was blatantly obvious. Large, lush hemlock and spruce and pine trees, draped in a mantle of mist, towered up from the forest floor in a carpet of vivid evergreen splendor.<br><br>The cane in his hand suddenly began to hum with delicate power. A warm, familiar energy coursed up his arm, and Daar closed his eyes to savor the distinct feel of his long-lost staff.<br><br>"What is it, old man? What's happening?" Morgan asked, taking a step back, eyeing the humming cane as it twisted and grew in length and thickness.<br><br>"Here. Touch this," Daar said, holding out his staff. "Feel it, Morgan. 'Tis the energy of life."<br><br>"I'm not touching that accursed thing."<br><br>"It won't bite," Daar snapped, poking the warrior in the belly.<br><br>Morgan instinctively grabbed the cane to protect himself, his eyes widening as the warm cherrywood sent its vibrations up his arm and into his body.<br><br>"There. That's what it's about, warrior. That's the life force. Have you forgotten what passion feels like?"<br><br>Morgan let go and stepped back, rubbing his hand on his shirt as he did. "I've forgotten nothing, old man. Now, point that thing at the valley and say your words. Tell me what's happening down there."<br><br>Daar pointed his staff toward the valley below and began to chant his ancient language. The burls on his cane warmed. The breeze kicked into a wind, sending the mist into swirling puffs of chaos around them. Birds and squirrels scurried for cover, and the distant roar of the falls turned to a whisper.<br><br>Daar opened one eye to peek at Morgan. The man had his hands balled into fists, his eyes scrunched closed, and his head pulled into his shoulders, his jaw clenched with enough force to break his teeth. And the poor warrior appeared to be holding his breath.<br><br>"It would go much better if you helped," Daar said. "Grab hold of the staff with me, Morgan, and concentrate. Feel the energy first, then see it in your mind's eye."<br><br>Morgan MacKeage slowly laid his hand over the second burl on the cane, his grip tight enough almost to splinter the wood. Together they waved the staff, which had nearly doubled in length, over the valley.<br><br>"Now. Tell me what you see, warrior. Tell me, and I will interpret it for you."<br><br>"Light. I see blinding light, yet it does not hurt my eyes."<br><br>"What color is the light?"<br><br>"Can you not see it yourself, <i>dr�idh</i>? It's white. I can feel the heat, but I don't feel burned. And yellow. I see yellow sparks."<br><br>"And what is the yellow light doing?"<br><br>"It's dancing through the white light in dizzying <br><br>circles, as if searching for something."<br><br>"What else do you see?"<br><br>"There is green also, chasing the yellow light."<br><br>Daar swept the staff into an arc farther afield, then stopped, bracing himself for the jolt of energy he knew was coming. The light intensified, swirling the colors into a blinding rainbow. The staff jerked, tugging at their hands as the new energy hit with the force of a tornado.<br><br>The warrior was not prepared. He staggered back against the assault but did not let go of his powerful grip.<br></p><h2>Stress Free for Good: 10 Scientifically Proven Life Skills for Health and Happiness</h2><p><p>Ten Minutes to Learn One Minute to Practice Ten Seconds to Work</p><p>Imagine if you could . . . </p><ul> <li>Radically reduce stress </li><li>Increase your physical vitality </li><li>Improve your quality of life </li></ul><p>Now you can.

Blight , because he had organized the logistics of shipping 50,000 Soviet soldiers and their nuclear weapons to Cuba in 1962. That same year, Smith was an aide to the Pentagon's top officer, Maxwell Taylor. Here, each veteran of the missile crisis presents his personal recollections of the event--Gribkov's narration being more personal than Smith's, who, by contrast, seems detached. The difference arises because Gribkov was sweating on the ground in Cuba, pushing forward the secret missile deployment, while Smith was an intelligence traffic cop, trying to make sense of all the frantic activity. Smith also tends not to dramatize Kennedy's Cold War policies, making them seem almost routine--except for his interesting passages about the military's vehement opposition to JFK's no-invasion pledge. The military demanded an invasion forthwith, which many think would have started World War III. But would it have? Gribkov startlingly reveals that at the moment the Russian presence was discovered, Moscow <i>withdrew</i> authority to use atomic weapons if an invasion occurred. Such a significant fact punches this specialty book's meal ticket; however, collections ought first to have Michael Beschloss' <i>Crisis Years</i> (1992) or Dino A. Brugioni's <i>Eyeball to Eyeball</i> (1991). <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>Thirty years ago the United States and the Soviet Union stood at the brink of nuclear war over Cuba. Since that time a great deal has been written about the crisis, almost all from our side. Gribkov, who oversaw the shipment of the Soviet weaponry across thousands of miles of ocean, recounts in detail how the Russians were able to move 40,000 Soviet troops and countless tons of nuclear missiles and equipment to Cuba, all without detection from American military surveillance. Smith, an assistant to Maxwell Taylor, attended many of the crisis meetings Kennedy held during those tense days in October 1962. Gribkov argues that the Soviet Union feared an American invasion of Cuba and installed the weapons as a deterrence. Smith relates how Kennedy and his advisers saw Khrushchev's Cuban gambit as a strategic counterpart to the boiling situation in Berlin. The authors, especially Gribkov, provide a unique perspective from which to view our nation's most fearsome crisis. Recommended for general collections.

No examples survive of this era&#39;s beautifully sculpted grounds, and we are left only with inaccurate, romanticized reconstructions created in Victorian times. In this pioneering study, however, Roy Strong paints a vivid portrait of such legendary garden complexes as those of Henry VIII&#39;s Hampton Court, Lord Burghley&#39;s Theobalds, and Lord Pembroke&#39;s Wilton. Using rare plans, diagrams, and engravings from the period, the author evokes not only the lost gardens, but also the people and ideas that led to their creation. Intertwined with this story, which touches on the history of politics, art, architecture, literature, and ideas, are some of the great figures of the age: Francis Bacon, Inigo Jones, the Countess of Bedford, and Charles I.</p><p>A coherent and detailed history of the English garden.

She was a fine dramatic and light comedic actress, and was considered by a number of authorities to be the greatest all-around dancer of her generation. And for a brief moment in 1950, she was an American household name, as famous as Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio or General Douglas MacArthur. She could do tap, toe dancing, adagio, modern dance (formerly known as dramatic dancing), comic dancing, partnered dancing, prop dancing, Apache dancing and advanced acrobatics. She could also sing well enough to be featured on Broadway and television. Her obsessive perfectionism was legendary; nobody worked harder on a routine or accomplished it with greater attention to detail. Not only were each of her steps perfect but the transitions from step to step were flawless and remarkably beautiful to observe. Like Fred Astaire, who admired her, she had the ability to make each complex routine seem effortless, as if she were expressing herself spontaneously. <p>Vera-Ellen's work in films such as On The Town, White Christmas, Words and Music, Three Little Words, The Belle of New York and Call Me Madame will never be forgotten by film musical fans. This much anticipated biography will not disappoint those fans.</p></p><p></p><h2>Obliquity: Why Our Goals Are Best Achieved Indirectly</h2><p><b>A leading economist charts the indirect road to happiness and wealth. </b> <br><br> Using dozens of practical examples from the worlds of business, politics, science, sports, literature, even parenting, esteemed economist John Kay proves a notion that feels at once paradoxical and deeply commonsensical: The best way to achieve any complex or broadly defined goal-from happiness to wealth to profit to preventing forest fires-is the indirect way. As Kay points out, we rarely know enough about the intricacies of important problems to tackle them head-on. And our unpredictable interactions with other people and the world at large mean that the path to our goals-and sometimes the goals themselves-will inevitably change. We can learn about our objectives and how to achieve them only through a gradual process of risk taking and discovery-what Kay calls obliquity. <br><br> Kay traces this pathway to satisfaction as it manifests itself in nearly every aspect of life. The wealthiest people-from Andrew Carnegie to Bill Gates-achieved their riches through a passion for their work, not because they set materialistic goals. Research has shown that companies whose goal (as declared in mission statements) is excellent products or service are more profitable than companies whose stated goal is increasing profits. In the personal realm, a large body of evidence shows that parenthood is on a daily basis far more frustrating than happy- making. Yet parents are statistically happier than nonparents. Though their short-term pleasure is often thwarted by the demands of childrearing, the subtle-oblique-rewards of parenthood ultimately make them happier. <br><br> Once he establishes the ubiquity of obliquity, Kay offers a wealth of practical guidance for avoiding the traps laid by the direct approach to complex problems. Directness blinds us to new information that contradicts our presumptions, fools us into confusing logic with truth, cuts us off from our intuition (which is the subconscious expression of our experience), shunts us away from alternative solutions that may be better than the one we're set on, and more. Kay also shows us how to acknowledge our limitations, redefine our goals to fit our skills, open our minds to new data and solutions, and otherwise live life with obliquity. <br><br> This bracing manifesto will convince readers-or confirm their conviction-that the best route to satisfaction and success does not run through the bottom line.</p><p><b>John Kay</b> is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and a fellow of St. John's College, Oxford University. As the director, he established the Institute for Fiscal Studies as one of Britain's most respected think tanks.This is an elegant, simple book and, rarely for a business book, is written by a man who actually understands the academics and philosophers he quotes.

But when the mother puts him in to bake, <em>she</em> gets the surprise of her life. The rabbit jumps to the floor, runs to the door, and disappears into the forest!</p><p>Fleeing through the forest with the mother close behind, the innocent rabbit gets some surprises of his own. The worst surprise is a "friendly" red animal who says he's a rabbit, too, though he looks just like a fox. The best surprise is a big brown rabbit and a silvery gray one, who live in a cozy cave full of carrots and lettuce -- where they happen to have an extra little bed.</p><p>Yes, all's well that ends well. The gingerbread rabbit finds himself a happy home, and the mother finds an even better way to surprise her daughter.</p></p><p>Mary's mother has a surprise for her--a delicious gingerbread rabbit. But the real surprises start when this cookie comes to life! The raisin-eyed rabbit, still uncooked on the counter, bemoans his fate to the paring knife, mixing bowl, and rolling pin, when they warn him that nothing has ever escaped from the kitchen without being eaten. When the rabbit spies Mary's mother, just back from the grocery store, a "giant" with "dozens of tremendous shining white teeth the size of a grizzly bear's," he realizes he hasn't a chance. Much to the mother's surprise, her flat, doughy creation makes a run for it! But she wants the gingerbread rabbit for her daughter so much, she races right after him. Garth Williams, illustrator of <i>Charlotte's Web</i> and <i>The Cricket in Times Square</i> captures the chase perfectly with his magical pen-and-ink sketches. Readers will follow breathlessly as the gingerbread rabbit narrowly escapes the guiles of a wily fox, and is finally rescued by an actual rabbit and his wife, who take him into their home to live happily ever after eating lettuce, carrots, and watercress. <p> This gentle story of a mother's fervent love for her only daughter, and the comical, suspenseful adventures of her rabbit cookie is carefully spun in Jarrell's flawless, slightly tongue-in-cheek prose. A jauntier inanimate rabbit-comes-to-life story than Margery Williams's <i>The Velveteen Rabbit</i>, and a more complex tale than <i>The Gingerbread Man</i>, <i>The Gingerbread Rabbit</i> is a classic read-aloud that youngsters will clamor for again and again.

Wat inverts the conventions of religion, politics, and culture to fantastic effect, illuminating the anarchic conditions of existence in interwar Europe.<br><br>The title story finds a superbly ironic Lucifer wandering the Europe of the late 1920s in search of a mission: what impact can a devil have in a godless time? What is his sorcery in a society far more diablical than the devil himself? Too idealistic for a world full of modern cruelties, the unemployable Lucifer finally finds the only means of guaranteed immortality. In "The Eternally Wandering Jew," steady Jewish conversion to Christianity results in Nathan the Talmudist reigning as Pope Urban IX.

These detachments had the mission of spreading the Stosstrupptaktik, a new tactic which decisively transformed the fighting methods of the German Army. But long before this happened, another type of troops had been created within the German infantry during the winter of 1914-1915: the Shock troops (Stosstruppen), fresh infantry groups that were never officially recognized as such and never belonged to any permanent unit, but remained active until the end of the war and contributed to improving the offensive capacity of the German infantry.<br><br>This book is a narration of the history of the shock and assault troops and covers their combat methods.

(Never mind that he revived him years later to write <i>The Regulators</i>.) At the beginning of <i>The Dark Half</i> (1989), 39-year-old writer Thad Beaumont announces in public that his own pseudonym, George Stark, is dead. <p> Now, King didn't want to jettison the Bachman novel, titled <i>Machine Dreams</i>, that was he working on. So he incorporated it in <i>The Dark Half</i> as the crime oeuvre of George Stark, whose recurring hero/alter ego is an evil character named Alexis Machine.</p><p> Thad Beaumont's pseudonym is not so docile as Stephen King's, though, and George Stark bursts forth into reality. At that point, two stories kick into gear: a mystery-detective story about the crime spree of George Stark (or is it Alexis Machine?) and a horror story about Beaumont's struggle to catch up with his doppelganger and kill him dead.</p><p> This is not the first time that Stephen King has written a dark allegory about the fiction writer's situation. As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "<i>Misery</i> (1987) is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death. <i>The Dark Half</i> is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes, the fratricidal twin who occupies 'the womblike dungeon' of his imagination." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

All others are expected to observe the &#39;seven laws of Noah&#39;: one positive commandment to set up courts of justice and six prohibitions against idolatry, blasphemy, murder, sexual misconduct, theft, and eating the limb of a live animal. These laws are principles that provide the keys to a civilized world, the right relationship between Jews and non-Jews, and the spiritual development of non-Jewish peoples. Unfortunately, they have been largely unknown for centuries. With the re-emergence of Israel and increased religious freedom in other nations, Jews are once again actively fulfilling the commandment to teach the Seven Laws to non-Jews. As a result, people in all parts of the world have begun to study the Laws, and there is renewed interest in the role played by the nations of the world in the Messianic Redemption.

Those on the left tend to distrust economists, seeing them as friends of the right. There is something to this, since professional economists are almost all keen supporters of the free market. Yet while factions on the right naturally embrace economists, they also tend to overestimate the effect of their support on free-market policies. The result is widespread confusion. In fact, virtually all commonly held beliefs about economics--whether espoused by political activists, politicians, journalists or taxpayers--are just plain wrong.<br><br>Professor Joseph Heath wants to raise our economic literacy and empower us with new ideas. In <i>Economics Without Illusions</i>, he draws on everyday examples to skewer the six favourite economic fallacies of the right, followed by impaling the six favourite fallacies of the left. Heath leaves no sacred cows untipped as he breaks down complex arguments and shows how the world really works. The popularity of such books as Freakonomics and Predictably Irrational demonstrates that people want a better understanding of the financial forces that affect them.&nbsp; Highly readable, cogently argued and certain to raise ire along all points of the socio-political spectrum, <i>Economics Without Illusions </i>offers readers the economic literacy they need to genuinely understand and critique the pros and cons of capitalism.</p><p>JOSEPH HEATH is an associate professor at the University of Toronto, where he teaches in the Department of Philosophy and the School of Public Policy and Governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is the author of three previousbooks: Nation of Rebels: Why Counterculture Became Consumer Culture (with Andrew Potter); Communicative Action and Rational Choice, which won the Canadian Philosophical Association Book Prize for 2003; and The Efficient Society, a Maclean's and Globe and Mail bestseller selected by the Globe as one of the best books of 2001. He writes a monthly column for the journal Policy Options and is a frequent contributor to The Montreal Gazette.Chapter 1<br><i>Capitalism Is Natural<br>Why the market actually depends on government<br><br></i>People often complain about the absence of &#x201c;big ideas&#x201d; in contemporary political debate. There is some truth to this. Politics in the twentieth century was often characterized by sharp disagreements over fundamental issues, with various factions wanting to completely overhaul society in all sorts of dramatic ways. In the 1920s, for instance, eugenics&#x2014;the selective breeding of human populations&#x2014;was all the rage in political circles. Winston Churchill, an enthusiastic proponent, thought it was essential to stem what he called, with a candor typical of his era, &#x201c;the unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the feeble-minded and insane classes.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, of course, there were fascism and the &#x201c;world communist revolution&#x201d;&#x2014;both of which involved what were, in retrospect, rather unlikely proposals. Consider V. I. Lenin, in 1918, still confi dently predicting the &#x201c;withering away of the state&#x201d; under communism. Getting rid of the market economy and replacing it with central planning would be no big deal, he thought&#x2014;a matter of &#x201c;watching, recording and issuing receipts,&#x201d; tasks that were &#x201c;within the reach of anybody who can read and write and knows the fi rst four rules of arithmetic.&#x201d;<br><br>In the &#x2019;50s, it seemed there wasn&#x2019;t a problem in the world that couldn&#x2019;t be solved by &#x201c;science.&#x201d; Women in the United States stopped breastfeeding en masse, figuring that baby formula had to be better&#x2014;after all, it was made by scientists! How much longer could it be before they solved other social problems, like crime or disease? John F. Kennedy spoke for many when he predicted that technocracy, not democracy, was the future. &#x201c;Most of the problems that we now face,&#x201d; he claimed, &#x201c;are technical problems, are administrative problems&#x201d; best dealt with by experts.<br><br>This technocratic consensus lasted long enough for Daniel Bell to publish his famously ill-timed book, <i>The End of Ideology</i>, in 1960. The ink was barely dry on the page before things went completely haywire, ushering in one of the most intensely ideological periods in Western history. The &#x2019;60s counterculture arose, promising no less than a complete transformation of both human civilization and consciousness. Sex, drugs, and rock and roll were presented not just as entertaining distractions from the serious business of life, but as forces that would fundamentally transform the family, the economy, the state, and the geopolitical system.<br><br>While the boomers didn&#x2019;t exactly deliver on these promises, one must admit that they gave it a college try. To take just one tiny example, by the early 1970s there were thousands of communes across the United States engaged in various forms of collective child rearing, trying to render the nuclear family obsolete through communal parenting.&nbsp;(A friend of mine in grad school had, in his youth, belonged to an ill-starred venture of this sort. He wound up with a dozen or so &#x201c;kids&#x201d; from this period, some of whom would occasionally drop by to visit him. Only one was his biological daughter.)<br><br>The point is this: There was a time, not so long ago, that when people talked about changing society, they generally had Big Plans. These plans were big in the sense that, had any of them worked, the world we live in would have been changed almost beyond recognition. Things are different now. People may complain just as loudly, but they generally<br>lack big ideas about how things should be redone. Or to speak more precisely: The big ideas that do remain are so obviously bad ideas (such as Islamic theocracy) that almost no psychologically well-balanced individual feels tempted by them. There is a stark difference between this ethos and a time when mild-mannered, middle-class people actually thought it might be helpful to tear down various pillars of Western civilization and rebuild everything from the ground up.<br><br>Nowadays, the disagreements that do remain tend to be over matters of detail. Political protest still carries the trappings of radicalism, but when you scratch the surface a bit, ask people what they really want, you typically end up with some fairly modest proposals. Antiglobalization protesters may still call for the overthrow of capitalism, but they&#x2019;re<br>usually willing to settle for an environmental protection rider or an amendment to the arbitration mechanism of the next free trade agreement. In France, activists have even insisted upon using the term altermondialisation to describe the movement, rather than antimondialisation, to emphasize the fact that they are not opposed to globalization&#x2014;they<br>would just like to see it done a bit differently.<br><br>Where have all the radicals gone? The movie <i>The Corporation</i>, after more than two hours of bluster about the &#x201c;psychopathic&#x201d; pursuit of money and power on the part of the modern business enterprise, ends with a call not for workers to seize control of the means of production or for the state to nationalize big business. Instead, it celebrates the outbreak of &#x201c;grassroots democracy&#x201d; in the town of Arcata, California (pop. 16,651), where citizens got together to&#x2014;brace yourself&#x2014;limit the number of franchise-operated fast food restaurants in the town to nine.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a reminder of the old joke about a Fabian socialist rally, where the protesters chant, &#x201c;What do we want? Gradual change! When do we want it? In due course!&#x201d;<br><br>In a sense, we are all Fabians now.<br><br>This state of affairs has been described in a variety of ways. Francis Fukuyama referred to it as the &#x201c;end of history.&#x201d; J�rgen Habermas, in a slightly less upbeat mood, described it as &#x201c;the exhaustion of utopian energies.&#x201d; The central element is the fact that liberal democracy has emerged out of the twentieth century as the only credible form of political organization, alongside some sort of regulated capitalism as the only plausible form of economic organization. As a result, all the serious participants in the political process&#x2014;and even a fair proportion of the wacky ones&#x2014;find themselves espousing what are essentially variations on the same basic blueprint for society. Everyone winds up defending&#x2014;or, better yet, presupposing&#x2014;some version of welfare-state capitalism. Of course, the welfare state has all the characteristics that a woman typically seeks in a husband, not a lover. It&#x2019;s safe, reliable, and a good provider. As a result, it tends to generate a fairly steady stream of grievances. But as everyone knows, there&#x2019;s a big difference between complaining about your husband and actually leaving your husband. Suffice it to say that, right now, divorce does not look imminent.</p><h2>Sun Dance, Water Dance</h2><p>Filled with vibrant illustrations and lyrical text, a delightful celebration of summer follows a group of friends as they enjoy a wonderful day outside splashing in the water, baking in the sun, running around barefoot, having picnics in the shade, and sleeping under the stars.</p><p>Jonathan London is the creator of twenty-three books about lovable and enduringly popular Froggy. He is also a poet and a novelist. Jonathan and his wife live in Graton, California.Kindergarten-Grade 3-A poetic evocation of summer fun. London's flowing text takes an energetic group of kids through a hot, sunny day to a cool, starry night. The unnamed children cavort in the current, skip stones, stop for snacks and cold drinks, and then continue to explore their watery, woodsy world. Eventually they come to rest on large rocks "holding/the last heat" as they watch the sky for falling stars. Their world is idyllic, but not without danger. They must be "careful for snakes/and the sharp bite/of rocks/like arrowheads" as they walk through the water. More than just a catalog of activities, London's text captures the children's joy, the beauty of the natural world, and the timeless appeal of simple pleasures. Couch's paintings swirl with energy and feature vivid colors-cool, watery blues, purples, and greens contrasting with bright, sunny yellows and fiery reds. The somewhat stylized artwork occasionally has a surreal look. Skin tones and surroundings take on unusual, sunbathed colors as the children frolic on the shore and splash in the water. Interestingly, this play of light and shadow allows the characters to be more representational than realistic and to stand for any children, anywhere, anytime. Use this as a terrific seasonal selection or as a warm splash of memory when the weather is foul.<br><i>Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, PA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Codebreaker in the Far East</h2><p>This unique work, written by the editor of the bestselling <em>Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park</em>, is the first to chronicle the British wartime successes in breaking Japanese codes during World War II. Other veterans of Bletchley Park have described how they broke the German Enigma machine to produce Ultra intelligence which helped to hasten victory in the war. There have also been been accounts of how the United States broke the Purple cipher and a navel code, even before Pearl Harbor. Here, Alan Stripp details the monumental British achievement at Bletchley Park and the Far East as these remarkable people broke codes of dazzling variety and complexity, powerfully contributing to the victory in Burma three months before Hiroshima. This firsthand account shows the magnitude of the task: grappling with one of the world's most daunting languages, learning the skills of cyptanalysis, turning out decrypts against the clock, and weaving together all the strands of intelligence to help vanquish a dogged and resourceful enemy who had never known defeat. It is a success story that conveys the sheer excitement of reading the enemy's mind, offering many surprises along the way: who would have expected Japanese signals to reveal not only what they were up to in Asia but also details of German aircraft, the latest U-boats, even the Normandy beach defences. With fascinating explanations of how codes were sent, intercepted, and broken, this personal and readable narrative makes perfectly clear vital importance of codebreakers to the outcome of the war.</p><p><br>Alan Stripp is Director of the Cambridge University Summer Schools on British Secret Services.

Gallatin was the first president of the council of New York University and his name lives on at NYU&#x2019;s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, so it is with pride that New York University Press and the Swiss Confederation publish this new biography of Gallatin.</p><p>Gallatin&#x2019;s story is the opposite of the classic American immigrant tale. Born in Geneva, the product of an old and noble family and highly educated in the European tradition, Gallatin made contributions to America throughout his career that far outweighed any benefit he procured for himself. He got his first taste of politics as a Pennsylvania state representative and went on to serve in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Gallatin became the Secretary of Treasury in Jefferson&#x2019;s administration and, despite being of the opposite political party to Alexander Hamilton, Gallatin fully respected his predecessor&#x2019;s fiscal politics. Gallatin undertook a special diplomatic mission for President Madison, which ended the War of 1812 with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent and gave the United States its genuine independence. Gallatin continued in diplomacy as minister to France and to Great Britain, where he skillfully combined his American experience and European background. In the early 1830s, at the age of seventy, he retired from politics and commenced a new career in New York City as a banker, public figure, and intellectual. He helped establish New York University and the American Ethnological Society, became an expert in Native American ethnology and linguistics, and served as president of the New-York Historical Society. Gallatin died at age 88 and is buried in Trinity churchyard at Broadway and Wall Street.</p><p>In our own day, as we look at reforming our financial system and seek to enhance America&#x2019;s global image, it is well worth resurrecting Albert Gallatin&#x2019;s timeless contributions to the United States, at home and abroad.

"They are a kind of collective dreaming, filled with timeless symbols and images we can all relate to, regardless of age or culture. And, much as an oyster must be disturbed by a grain of sand in order for the pearl to be created, I often choose to retell stories in which I find unresolved fragments that are somehow perplexing to me."</p><p>Though widely known as a children's book writer, Marianna Mayer's early education focused on visual art. "It seems to me there was never a time when I didn't want to be an artist, " she says. "I liked to tell stories with pictures and compose music. My sister and I put on plays made up from my stories. And then I decided to start writing a book, at the age of nine." She published her first book at the age of nineteen. After college, she studied painting at the Art Students League in New York City. Her experiences as an artist provided many images that she began to incorporate into writing. Gradually, she shifted to the written word as a medium of expression. She explains, "I began to feel more freedom when using words as my paints and plots as my canvases.</p><p>"While in the midst of a writing project, I live so much in my mind that what takes place in my imagination becomes quite real to me. I try to become part of the culture of a particular tale as much as possible. While working on<i> Baba Yaga and Vasilisa the Brave,</i> for example, I read all I could about Russia. What I learned about Slavic mythology helped to deepen my understanding of the story. I listened to Russian music, ate Russian food (which I love!), and tried in other small ways to enter into the essence of that culture."</p><p>"My writing is deeply personal. First and foremost I write for the child who still lives within me. Then to the child in others, whether that child resides in a young person or an adult. I'm striving to reach out to that spirit of wonder within us all. The stories I was told as a child, those half-remembered folktales and myths, have become the foundation for what I continue to work on in my books. The sense of hope that books instilled in me as a child saw me through many difficult times. Because of this, I choose characters who face overwhelming odds but triumph through courage and perseverance. Similarly, myth allows a child to believe in his or her own dreams and can instill a boundless hope for the future."</p>Grade 3-5-An engaging text and accomplished paintings set this version apart from the recent crop of retellings of this popular Russian variant of the Cinderella tale. After the death of her father, Vasilisa is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters; her only comfort is the magical doll made by her mother before she died. Sent to Baba Yaga's house to fetch a light, the girl becomes the witch's servant and is given a series of impossible tasks to perform. With the help of her doll, she pleases the demanding hag, who sends her home with the precious light. After it destroys her stepmother and stepsisters, Vasilisa goes to live with an elderly woman and learns to spin and weave. She creates an exquisite piece of cloth that catches the attention of the tsar. He seeks out its maker, finds the heroine, and asks for her hand in marriage. Mayer's graceful prose conveys both the wonder and power of the tale. Complementing the text are Craft's illustrations done in a mixture of watercolor, gouache, and oils. The palette of red and gold set against a dark background resembles Russian folk-art paintings on black-lacquered wood. The pictures are often dark, and the depiction of Baba Yaga is not for the weakhearted. The use of decorative capital letters, elegant typeface, and small drolleries add to the visual appeal of each page. A stylized and classy offering that's ideal for older picture-book audiences.<br><i>Denise Anton Wright, Illinois State University, Normal</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Book of Mormon</h2><p>The Book of Mormon is a translation of golden tablets given to Joseph Smith who wrote of their account of a plan for salvation and what men must do to gain peace in this life and eternal redemption in the life to come.

The stated purpose of this project is to exemplify the diversity of Native nations, both past and present. This intention is beautifully carried out, but leads to unfortunate, yet probable confusion. While most of the pictures depict historical dress, settings, and activities, the letter N is represented by a contemporary Navajo man wearing jeans and cowboy boots. Without informed guidance, children may miss the distinction between modern day and historical illustrations, and, therefore, develop inaccurate impressions or generalizations. The use of hanging participles adds to the confusion. Also, among the wonderful variety of tribes shown are two letters represented by animals; while it is not hard to make the connection between them and the peoples, it is not stated. The author's note is helpful but brief, and lacks a pronunciation guide.

Colonialism in Latin America originated centuries earlier, in the transoceanic adventures from which European modernity itself was born. <i>Coloniality at Large</i> brings together classic and new reflections on the theoretical implications of colonialism in Latin America. By pointing out its particular characteristics, the contributors highlight some of the philosophical and ideological blind spots of contemporary postcolonial theory as they offer a thorough analysis of that theory&#x2019;s applicability to Latin America&#x2019;s past and present. <p>Written by internationally renowned scholars based in Latin America, the United States, and Europe, the essays reflect multiple disciplinary and ideological perspectives. Some are translated into English for the first time. The collection includes theoretical reflections, literary criticism, and historical and ethnographic case studies focused on Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Brazil, the Andes, and the Caribbean. Contributors examine the relation of Marxist thought, dependency theory, and liberation theology to Latin Americans&#x2019; experience of and resistance to coloniality, and they emphasize the critique of Occidentalism and modernity as central to any understanding of the colonial project. Analyzing the many ways that Latin Americans have resisted imperialism and sought emancipation and sovereignty over several centuries, they delve into topics including violence, identity, otherness, memory, heterogeneity, and language. Contributors also explore Latin American intellectuals&#x2019; ambivalence about, or objections to, the &#x201c;post&#x201d; in postcolonial; to many, globalization and neoliberalism are the contemporary guises of colonialism in Latin America.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>: Arturo Arias, Gordon Brotherston, Santiago Castro-G�mez, Sara Castro-Klaren, Amaryll Chanady, Fernando Coronil, Rom�n de la Campa, Enrique Dussel, Ram�n Grosfoguel, Russell G.

Artaban, the fourth wise man, arranges to meet his three scholarly friends, all of whom plan to follow the bright star in the sky that their studies have told them signals the birth of the King of the Jews. However, he is delayed when he stops to nurse a desperately ill man back to life. The other Magi leave without him, but Artaban continues alone to Bethlehem, selling one of his precious gifts to purchase camels for his own caravan. Once again he is delayed by his generous spirit when he sacrifices another treasure to rescue a woman and her child from Herod's soldiers. Artaban travels for years "and though he found no King of Kings to worship, he found many people to help. Wherever he went, he fed the hungry and clothed the naked; he healed the sick and he visited those in prison..." Even as he goes to succor Jesus before His Crucifixion, Artaban stops to help a young girl and, at last, his goodness is recognized. This is a deeply moving story, simply and strongly retold. Lush, glowing watercolor illustrations capture the heat of the desert and the nobility of the wise man while perfectly complementing this tale about the truest meaning of Christmas.?AC<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5^-9. In a short story written in the 1800s, Henry Van Dyke imagined what it would have been like had there been a fourth wise man, one who did not complete the journey to see the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. Summers' retelling, based on Van Dyke's story, introduces Artaban, a Zoroastrian man living in Persia. Artaban sets off to meet his three friends Caspar, Melchior, and Balthazar, but he stops along the way to assist a dying man, rescue a child in Herod's Massacre of the Innocents, and save a woman about to be sold into slavery. Artaban misses his chance to worship Jesus, but at the end of his life, he is rewarded for helping the needy: "As often as you did these things for the least of my children, you did them for me." The touching story flows smoothly and eloquently, and the richly colored illustrations capture the book's emotional intensity with careful attention to the setting's place and time. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i></p><h2>Lars Tunbj�rk: I Love Boras</h2><p>In <i>I Love Bor s</i>, photographer Lars Tunbj�rk documents his aimless journey around Sweden between 1988 and 1995.

And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda."

After losing hundreds of thousands of dollars back when a beer cost a nickel, he found himself neck-deep in debt. His heiress wife, Livy, took the setback hard. &#x201c;I have a perfect<i>&nbsp;horror</i>&nbsp;and heart-sickness over it,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;I cannot get away from the feeling that business failure means disgrace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But Twain vowed to Livy he would pay back every penny. And so, just when the fifty-nine-year-old, bushy-browed icon imagined that he would be settling into literary lionhood, telling jokes at gilded dinners, he forced himself to mount the &#x201c;platform&#x201d; again, embarking on a round-the-world stand-up comedy tour. No author had ever done that. He cherry-picked his best stories&#x2014;such as stealing his first watermelon and buying a bucking bronco&#x2014;and spun them into a ninety-minute performance.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twain trekked across the American West and onward by ship to the faraway lands of Australia, New&nbsp;Zealand, Tasmania, India, Ceylon, and South Africa.&nbsp;He rode an elephant twice and visited the Taj Mahal.&nbsp;He saw Zulus dancing and helped sort diamonds at&nbsp;the Kimberley mines. (He failed to slip away with a&nbsp;sparkly souvenir.) He played shuffleboard on cruise&nbsp;ships and battled captains for the right to smoke&nbsp;in peace. He complained that his wife and daughter made him shave and change his shirt every day.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The great American writer fought off numerous&nbsp;illnesses and travel nuisances to circle the globe and&nbsp;earn a huge payday and a tidal wave of applause.&nbsp;Word of his success, however, traveled slowly enough that one American newspaper reported that he had&nbsp;died penniless in London. That&#x2019;s when he famously&nbsp;quipped: &#x201c;The report of my death was an exaggeration.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout his quest, Twain was aided by cutthroat Standard Oil tycoon H.H. Rogers, with&nbsp;whom he had struck a deep friendship, and he was&nbsp;hindered by his own lawyer (and future secretary&nbsp;of state) Bainbridge Colby, whom he deemed &#x201c;head idiot of this century.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In<i>&nbsp;Chasing the Last Laugh,</i>&nbsp;author Richard Zacks,&nbsp;drawing extensively on unpublished material in notebooks and letters from Berkeley&#x2019;s ongoing Mark Twain&nbsp;Project, chronicles a poignant chapter in the author&#x2019;s&nbsp;life&#x2014;one that began in foolishness and bad choices&nbsp;but culminated in humor, hard-won wisdom, and&nbsp;ultimate triumph.</p><p>Richard Zacks is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Island of Vice: Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s Quest to Clean Up Sin-Loving New York; Pirate Coast: Thomas Jefferson, the First Marines, and the Secret Mission of 1805; Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd; History Laid Bare;&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>An Underground Education.&nbsp;</i>His writing has been featured in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times, The Atlantic, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine,&nbsp;</i>and many other publications.

In the summer of 1893, he was by reputation America&#x2019;s greatest humorist and a successful publisher who was married to an heiress. He ranked among the nation&#x2019;s highest-�paid magazine writers and most prized after-�dinner speakers. His life&#x2014;�on paper&#x2014;�marked a fabulous success story, from Hannibal to Hartford to the family&#x2019;s current address abroad in Paris.<br><br>Twain owned a publishing house; it was failing. His latest book, a contrived, almost slapstick novella, The American Claimant, hadn&#x2019;t sold well; his backlist, even including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, was limping along, bringing in small change.<br><br>The publishing house owed money to bookbinders, paper suppliers, printers, owed rent for a plush office at 67 Fifth Avenue, at 14th Street; meanwhile, their list included underwhelming titles such as Stories from the Rabbis and One Hundred Desserts and Tenting on the Plains by General Custer&#x2019;s widow. Twain had invested heavily in a typesetter that had 18,000 moving parts but was supposed to revolutionize the printing industry.<br><br>Twain teetered on the brink of financial ruin. At first he blamed himself for numerous bad business decisions, but once he got that formality out of the way, he unleashed his sizable writing talents on blaming others.<br><br>He wrote in a private notebook his thoughts on the inventor James W. Paige, whom he had amply funded but who still had not delivered his invention. &#x201c;[He] and I always meet on effusively affectionate terms; and yet he knows perfectly well that if I had his nuts in a steel-�trap I would shut out all human succor and watch that trap till he died.&#x201d;<br><br>Twain and his wife owned their expensive home in Hartford, but they had run out of enough cash to live there in the style to which they were accustomed, with seven servants (a black butler, a gardener, cook, coachman, tutor and maids), and horses and an elegant carriage. They had moved out two years earlier, claiming Livy&#x2019;s health required a change of scenery and they chose Europe, which sounds odd for financially strapped people, but it was cheaper than their Hartford high life. They chose self-�exile over the public shame of a diminished lifestyle.<br><br>The beautiful mansion lay empty.<br><br>&#x201c;I have never felt so desperate in my life, for I haven&#x2019;t got a penny to my name &amp; Mrs. Clemens hasn&#x2019;t enough laid up with [her brother Charles] Langdon to keep us two months. . . . I do not sleep, these nights, for visions of the poor-�house. . . . Everything does look blue, so dismally blue.&#x201d;<br><br>Twain&#x2019;s publishing house had started off magnificently in 1885. He had installed his former gofer, his niece&#x2019;s thirty-�three-�year-�old husband, Charles L. Webster, to run it, even called it &#x201c;Charles L. Webster &amp; Co.&#x201d;&#x2014;�perhaps to insulate himself from blame. The quirky founding contract stipulated that Twain could &#x201c;not be called upon&#x201d; to perform any managerial or editorial duties but nonetheless would retain final approval of all new books.<br><br>The company&#x2019;s first two releases were Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant. One was a modest success; the other a record-�breaking blockbuster.<br><br>Grant&#x2019;s memoirs set publishing records, with 600,000 volumes issued and nearly $400,000 ($12 million in today&#x2019;s dollars) paid to the Grant family. Twain had lured the former president away from a verbal agreement with Century, calling for the general to receive industry-�standard royalties&#x2014;�10% of the cover price; Twain instead offered 70% of net profits (after printing expenses, etc.), which Twain promised&#x2014;�rightly&#x2014;�would turn out to be double the Century offer.<br><br>And, contrary to some reports, Twain did not write the memoirs. In fact, he was furious when Joseph Pulitzer&#x2019;s New York World charged that General Adam Badeau had ghostwritten many chapters as Grant lay dying from throat cancer. Twain dropped his threatened lawsuit, claiming he didn&#x2019;t want to give any free publicity to &#x201c;that daily issue of un-�medicated closet paper [i.e., toilet paper].&#x201d;<br><br>The seeds of ruin, however, sprouted early. Sad-�eyed, balding Webster failed to oversee the torrents of cash; a bookkeeper embezzled $25,000 (wound up in Sing Sing prison) and a Midwest book agent stole $30,000. These were huge sums in that era when a beer cost a nickel. The company signed up famed minister Henry Ward Beecher, but he died before he could complete his autobiography or his life of Christ. Civil War generals&#x2014;�Sheridan, Sherman, Winchester&#x2014;�lined up to repeat Grant&#x2019;s deluge of gold, but the public quickly tired of war memoirs.<br><br>The company pinned its hope on the pope, the immensely popular Leo XIII, whose face seemed to be everywhere, since his portrait accompanied an endorsement of Vin Mariani, a cocaine-�laced wine. Webster traveled to Rome, landed the contract, and was knighted to the Order of the Golden Spur, with robes and a ceremonial sword. (Webster later found himself the only papal knight in Fredonia, New York.)<br><br>&#x201c;[Twain] had no words in which to paint the magnificence of the project, or to forecast its colossal success,&#x201d; later recalled author-�editor-�friend William Dean Howells. It bombed, despite the unusual inclusion of two color chromolithographs of the pope. &#x201c;We did not consider how often Catholics could not read,&#x201d; surmised Howells.<br><br>Twain replaced Webster with young Fred Hall, a stenographer with no publishing experience; he said he was replacing &#x201c;guesswork&#x201d; with &#x201c;brains.&#x201d; But no one saw that the Library of American Literature was crushing the company under a mountain of debt.<br><br>Ironically, their biggest seller was destroying them. Salesmen had no trouble lining up tens of thousands of &#x201c;subscription&#x201d; orders for the eleven-�volume collection. The well-�respected editors Edmund Clarence Stedman and Ellen Mackay Hutchinson had skimmed the cream of Hawthorne, Melville, Longfellow, and the like to create a compendium of 1,207 authors, 2,671 selections, 303 full-�page illustrations. More than half the nation still lived on farms and in small towns, and rural buyers, especially fond of ornate bindings, could achieve instant gentility and respectability with the purchase.<br><br>But the business plan had one crucial flaw. Customers had to pay only the first $3 monthly installment of the $33 cover price to receive the entire set, but it cost the company $13 to print, bind, and ship, and another $12 in commission to the agents. The publisher was $22 in the red on every sale, and, as the economy soured, customers increasingly stopped paying installments. Delinquent payments ballooned from $28,862 in 1891 to $67,795 in 1892.<br><br>The office manager observed, Twain-�like: &#x201c;The faster installment orders came in, the faster our capital shrank, until our prosperity became embarrassing.&#x201d;<br><br>Twain himself called it a &#x201c;lingering suicide.&#x201d;<br><br>What had begun as a quest by author Twain to receive a fair shake from publishers had spiraled into a nightmare. Now, instead of furnishing money, his venture, Charles L. Webster &amp; Co., was sucking up cash. Twain deferred his royalties. Livy pumped in large sums, but the company eventually had to borrow from Harlem&#x2019;s Mount Morris Bank, itself on shaky ground because of a bad investment in the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad.<br><br>The whole country was reeling from the Panic of 1893, as the stock market had crashed in June and more than 16,000 businesses failed, and more than 2� million men were unemployed. Credit was tight and fear great.<br><br>Twain tried to unload his publishing house on Harper &amp; Bros. but failed. &#x201c;I want to sell because I am not made for business,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The worry of it makes me old &amp; robs life of its zest.&#x201d;<br><br>Twain had one overriding fear: that in the chaos of his publishing house suddenly going under he might lose the copyrights to his own books, that Huckleberry Finn might wind up owned by a bank or a printer. &#x201c;If they go, I am a beggar,&#x201d; he wrote on August 14, 1893, to the man running his publishing house.<br><br>On Monday, September 11, 1893, he learned that a Webster Company debt note for $8,000 ($240,000 today) would be coming due in one week. He had tapped out his ability to borrow from his depressed brother-�in-�law, who had recently cosigned $21,000 in Mount Morris Bank loans for them. Twain had no cash but was using his Cosmopolitan magazine fee for &#x201c;The Esquimaux Maiden&#x2019;s Romance&#x201d; to live on. He was saving more money by staying at the home of his friend Dr. Clarence Rice, throat surgeon to the Metropolitan Opera; the Century, America&#x2019;s most prestigious monthly, was so squeezed it had refused to pay Twain for his new novella Pudd&#x2019;nhead Wilson until it started running in November. Fred Hall, who had stopped drawing a salary, was near broke and had already borrowed $15,000 ($450,000 today) for Webster &amp; Co. from family friends, the Barrows.<br><br>(A quick note on historical dollar values; day laborers made 15 cents an hour; a fine three-�bedroom Manhattan apartment rented for $80 a month; economists suggest multiplying 1890s dollars by thirty to gain an approximate value in the early twenty-�first century.)<br><br>A sudden failure could put the creditors in control, could open Twain to lawsuits by companies that might succeed in seizing his home and his books.<br><br>As Twain put it, &#x201c;the billows of hell&#x201d; began rolling over him. He didn&#x2019;t want to go to Hartford&#x2014;�where people would ask embarrassing questions about why the Clemens family had not returned after two years, but he forced himself.<br><br>Twain walked over to Grand Central Depot on Tuesday evening, and under the magnificent 200-�yard glass dome covering the platforms boarded a train to Hartford. He did not go to his home on Farmington Avenue, his beautiful burnt-�orange confection of turrets and balconies. He visited two wealthy Hartford businessmen, longtime friends, members of the informal Friday night billiards club, Edward M. Bunce and Henry C. Robinson. He wanted to borrow $5,000.<br><br>They turned him down. He sat in the parlor of lawyer Robinson&#x2014;�former mayor of Hartford, twice nominated for governor&#x2014;�with bank executive Bunce, and the trio brainstormed for an hour. They came to the conclusion that it was hopeless; Bunce had heard of a Chicago millionaire during this Panic of 1893 turned down trying to raise $600,000 on prime real estate worth four times that amount. Robinson told Twain he couldn&#x2019;t borrow even $3,000 on his Farmington Avenue home, even though Twain claimed it was worth $170,000.<br><br>He later wrote to Livy: &#x201c;My friends . . . they were not moved, not strongly interested, &amp; I was ashamed that I went.&#x201d; And Twain spent the night at the Bunces&#x2019; but informed Livy he had seen no one else in Hartford. She was obsessed with keeping their financial setbacks secret.<br><br>&#x201c;The holy passion of Friendship is of so sweet &amp; steady &amp; loyal &amp; enduring a nature that it will last through the whole lifetime if not asked to lend money.&#x201d; He had written those lines a year earlier as a Pudd&#x2019;nhead Wilson maxim.<br><br>Twain&#x2014;�in those days of few telephones&#x2014;�sent a telegram to Livy&#x2019;s sister, Sue, saying, &#x201c;I have no shame; the boat is sinking,&#x201d; and asked for $5,000. She said she didn&#x2019;t have the cash, and her banker informed her that her bonds were not negotiable in New York, but she traded a bond with her sister-�in-�law, Ida. She said if Twain telegraphed on Friday, she&#x2019;d messenger the bond to him.<br><br>Twain and Hall walked the corridors of Wall Street, discreetly trying to find a loan. They failed. Hall told Twain that $5,000 from Sue wouldn&#x2019;t save them. They needed $8,000. Twain collapsed on the bed on Wednesday night at Dr. Rice&#x2019;s house, thinking he was a ruined man. With all the stress and travel, he had developed a deep, phlegmy hacking cough.<br><br>He was at the Webster offices Thursday when a messenger arrived from the plump, genial doctor. &#x201c;[Dr. Rice] told me he had ventured to speak to a rich friend of his who was an admirer of mine about our straits,&#x201d; wrote Twain. &#x201c;I was very glad.&#x201d;<br><br>Twain was told to send young Hall down to the gentleman&#x2019;s office at 26 Broadway, in the Standard Oil Building, the following afternoon with their account books. Apparently, the executive had absolutely loved Roughing It, Twain&#x2019;s tale of Nevada cowboys and silver mining mishaps; the executive had read it himself, then had read it aloud to his family.<br><br>Fred Hall showed up at 4 p.m. on Friday and in &#x201c;six minutes&#x201d; he had a check for $8,000 and their &#x201c;worries were over&#x201d;&#x2014;�temporarily.<br><br>Twain&#x2019;s new friend, worth about $50 million, was Henry Huttleston Rogers, a fifty-�three-�year-�old vice president at Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest men in America. Their friendship would last to the very last days of each man&#x2019;s life; it would disturb some of Twain&#x2019;s literary brethren; many biographers would gloss over it.<br><br>Around this time, they met briefly in a drawing room at the Murray Hill Hotel. They even resembled each other, with Rogers being slightly taller but slender with ample mustache and bushy eyebrows. Rogers&#x2019;s piercing blue eyes were mesmerizing, and at times distracting, during tough negotiations.<br><br>The affinity between the two men was near instant. They would quickly discover that they shared a love of Twain&#x2019;s writing, of cigars, boxing matches, poker and especially billiards; both liked practical jokes, hated opera, had strong senses of humor, heavy on the sarcasm and vitriol. (Rogers kept his hidden except for a circle of close friends.)<br><br>One perceptive observer of both men thought their bond was actually anchored in a profound &#x201c;mutual envy&#x201d;: Twain envied Rogers&#x2019;s financial prowess and his huge self-�made fortune, and Rogers envied Twain&#x2019;s popularity and unbuttoned irreverence.<br><br>H.H. Rogers, three years younger than Twain, spent his childhood in maritime Fairhaven, Massachusetts, working his way up from grocery store delivery boy to making a fortune in the oil industry. The nineteenth-�century oil boom, with wells first geysering in Pennsylvania, centered on supplying millions of gallons of illuminating oil to fill portable lamps in unelectrified cities and in rural America, replacing Civil War&#x2013;�era sperm-�whale oil. The market also mushroomed for oil by-�products such as varnish, paints, solvents, naphtha, long before the viscous black liquid was refined into automobile fuel.<br><br>H.H. Rogers over the weekend reviewed the Webster account books Hall had brought and by Monday had a more ambitious solution for Twain&#x2019;s dire cash shortage. He suggested selling the Library of American Literature and the subscription sales department to his son-�in-�law William Evarts Benjamin, a memorabilia dealer with a literary pedigree from his father, the poet Park Benjamin.<br><br>Why would the money-�hemorrhaging Library of American Literature appeal to Rogers? There was $67,000 in uncollected subscriptions, 585 eleven-�volume sets sitting in the warehouse, another 5,000 sets printed but unbound, printing plates, and a veteran sales force. Rogers and his son-�in-�law offered $50,000. Once the Panic ended and people could pay their bills, the property should rocket in value.<br><br>Twain was outraged by the price but didn&#x2019;t share his opinion with his very new acquaintance, Rogers. Instead he unleashed his fury that Monday on a respected Oxford-�educated copy editor at the Century magazine who had dared to change his punctuation in Pudd&#x2019;nhead Wilson. Twain wrote Livy: &#x201c;I said I didn&#x2019;t care if he was an Archangel imported from Heaven, he couldn&#x2019;t puke his ignorant impudence over my punctuation.&#x201d; Twain restored his commas and semicolons the following day.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Dragon Lensman</h2><p>As The Dragon Lensman opens, the Boskonian conspiracy seems to have been vanquished with its defeat at the great Battle of Klovia, and the victorious Galactic Patrol is busy re-orienting itself to face the new challenges of policing a galaxy instead of defending it against a ruthless invader. Among those adjusting to the new reality is Second Stage Lensman Worsel, the legendary warrior/scientist famed for his intelligence and dedication to the fight against ignorance and evil. Like all of his species, Worsel resembles the mythological dragons of old Tellus, with a sinewy, ten-meter-long body covered in scales and boasting great wings and terrifying claws and teeth. But Worsel&#39;s real strength is his mind and its unmatched psychic abilities, concentrated and focused by the Lens shining among his many eye-stalks.</p><p></p><h2>At Work in Paris: Raymond Mason on Art and Artists</h2><p>In 1946 the young artist Raymond Mason, having already quit his native Midlands for the Royal College of Art and later the Slade School, packed his bags for Paris, then the undisputed artistic capital of the world. There he found himself thrust into the company of some of the greatest figures of 20th-century art, from Balthus to Duchamp, Giacometti and Picasso, and, inspired by their examples, set out making his own distinctive contribution to the history of modern sculpture.</p><p>The artist Raymond Mason left his native Birmingham in 1946 to study in Paris, where he has lived ever since.

The first chapters explain the fundamentals that govern high-performance engines: thermodynamic laws, gasflow, mechanical efficiency, and engine materials and construction. Understanding these basic factors is crucial to making correct decisions when tuning or modifying your engine. Actual engine preparation techniques are described in the middle section, including cylinder head work and balancing and blueprinting. The final part of the book focuses on modifying specific engines: American V8s, Porsche 911, Volkswagen Air-cooled and Water-cooled, Cosworth BDA, Formula Ford 1600, Datsun 4- and 6-cylinder, and Mazda rotary engines. You&#39;ll learn proven techniques to increase performance and reliability, and, just as important, which modifications won&#39;t give you meaningful gains.</p><p></p><h2>Lee Miller&#39;s War: Photographer and Correspondent With the Allies in Europe 1944-45</h2><p>Gathers photographs and articles by Miller, the only woman combat photographer allowed to follow the Allied advance across Western Europe</p><p>Antony Penrose is the son of Lee Miller and Roland Penrose and is director of the Lee Miller Archives and The Penrose Collection.

He earned a degree in history from Kenyon College in 1967 and a degree in psychiatry from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Despite this training, Wagner disliked the medical profession and abandoned it upon establishing himself as a writer; his disillusionment with the medical profession can be seen in the stories &#39;The Fourth Seal&#39; and &#39;Into Whose Hands&#39;. As well as being a multi-award winning author, Wagner was a highly successful editor and publisher of horror, science fiction and heroic fantasy, creating a definitive three-volume set of Robert E. Howard&#39;s Conan the Barbarian fiction, and edited the long-running and genre-defining Year&#39;s Best Horror and Fantasy series. Wagner is perhaps best known for his creation of the long-running series of stories featuring Kane, the Mystic Swordsman.

In the spring of 1947, putting the death and devastation of the Second World War behind him, Farley Mowat joined a scientific expedition to the north, seeking a saner world. In the remote, northern reaches of Manitoba, he encountered the Idthen Eldeli?People of the Caribou?a Dene people still living according to age-old traditions. Travelling still farther north, Mowat met the Ihalmiut, an Inuit people whose lives also revolved around the caribou. His companion, Metis trapper Charles Schweder, provided Mowat with an entree into the ancient cultures of these native peoples, and he came to know their land and ways with an intimacy achieved by few outsiders. Mowat was based at Windy Post with the Schweder clan, which included two Inuit children. The young girl, Kunee, also known as Rita, is painted with special vividness?checking the traplines with the men, riding atop a sled, smoking a tiny pipe. Farley returns to the north two decades later and discovers the tragic fate that awaited her. A rare glimpse into a lost world, No Man?s River is both an adventure tale and a heart-rending story of our indifference to the suffering of native and mixed-race peoples, told by one of the best-loved writers in the world.</p></p><p><br> <b>FARLEY MOWAT</b> began writing for a living in 1949 after spending two years in the Arctic. He has lived in or visited almost every part of Canada and many other lands, including the distant regions of Siberia. He is author of 39 books, including <i>People of the Deer</i>, <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>, <i>Sea of Slaughter</i>, <i>The Snow Walker</i>, <i>And No Birds Sang</i>, and <i>No Man's River</i>. With sales of more than 14 million copies in 25 languages, Farley Mowat is one of Canada's most successful writers. He and his wife, Claire Mowat, divide their time between Ontario and Nova Scotia.Having written more than 35 books (<i>People of the Deer</i>; <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>; etc.), Mowat (b. 1921) is certainly the pre-eminent chronicler of life on the Arctic frontier. Now he details an early Arctic adventure, a journey he took in 1947. After serving in the Canadian infantry in WWII, Mowat sought a peaceful, picturesque life in northern Manitoba, where he found circumstances that were less barbaric, but just as hard. Mowat describes joining a two-man zoological expedition on its way to an isolated camp run by a young trapper, Charles Schweder, and his family. Mowat's relationship with his expedition partner soon deteriorated, and he befriended Schweder. The two set out to help the local Eskimo population, who were struggling with smallpox and famine caused by dwindling caribou herds&#x2014;all the while under pressure themselves to survive on the barren land: stockpiling meat, conserving ammunition and scrambling from shelter to shelter. The book's heart lies with the conflicts among Schweder, his racist father, his brooding brother and the Eskimo children who came into their home. Mowat's vivid descriptions and careful storytelling bring the northern frontier to life as well as any fictional account, yet the characters are real and the adversities loom large. As a result, the quiet, sad fates that meet many of Mowat's friends&#x2014;both natives and pioneers&#x2014;will have a lasting effect on readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Meltzer, author of several other biographies from this publisher, including <i>Carl Sandburg</i> (1999) and <i>Walt Whitman </i>(2000), now introduces Poe. After a difficult youth, Poe married his cousin and struggled to support his family with a literary career that included creating groundbreaking poetry, short stories, and works in the mystery genre as well as many potboilers. Meltzer's analysis includes perceptive discussions of issues such as Poe's troubled relationship with his foster father and the probable causes and disastrous effects of Poe's alcoholism. More than most other biographers for young people, Meltzer places his subject within the framework of his society. Readers will come away not only with a greater knowledge of Poe's life and accomplishments but also a clearer picture of American life in the first half of the nineteenth century. Back matter includes a chronology, two bibliographies, and information about museums devoted to Poe.

Watching the guest of honor make the obligatory final curtain call evoked a predictable yet uncomfortable melancholy, but worse yet was the sense of the other guests' eyes upon her. She imagined their whispers: Isn't it about time we threw one of these parties for <i>her,</i> the dowager queen of the television drama? Doesn't she realize her time has passed? </p><p> As she raised her champagne flute to join the others in a toast to Maury, the man who had been her agent throughout her career, Julia forced herself to smile. Despite the critics' lukewarm appreciation of her talent, she knew she was a fine actress. No one would detect her dismay at realizing that she was one of the oldest people present, that she could no longer count on being the most beautiful woman in the room, that maybe it was best that she retire with some dignity instead of lingering on long past her prime. </p><p> No doubt the stars and would-be stars assembled there expected her own announcement soon, especially since <i>Family Tree</i> had just ended its lengthy run. She had hoped for at least another two years, but as the three endearing cherubs who played her grandchildren grew into sulky adolescents with various addictions and attitude problems, the program's once-spectacular ratings had begun a gradual but unmistakably downward slide. The final blow had come the previous winter, when the actor who played her son-in-law developed a particularly nasty infection in one of his pectoral implants. When his hospitalization forced them to shut down production for a month and show reruns during sweeps week, the studio heads decided not to renew any of their contracts. Most of the cast moved on to other projects, but for the first time in over two decades, Julia found herself facing a summer hiatus that threatened to extend indefinitely. </p><p> If she were planning to leave the business, this would seem to be the time to do it. Money wouldn't be a problem; she had invested her earnings so wisely that she wouldn't need to earn a paycheck to maintain her lifestyle -- even with the ungodly amount of alimony she had to pay her third husband. But to retire now, before she had starred in a hit movie, something meaningful and important and true -- that would be unbearable. </p><p> A handsome young waiter smiled as he offered her another glass of champagne. Drowning her sorrows didn't seem like such a bad idea, given that her series was over and Maury was abandoning her, so she placed her empty glass on the waiter's tray and took another. As she raised it to her lips, Maury caught her eye and inclined his head in the direction of his study. She took a hasty sip and nodded to indicate she would join him there. If he intended to scold her for drinking too much, she'd scold him right back. What was he thinking, retiring when she needed him so desperately? </p><p> "You look lovely," he greeted her, kissing her on the cheek as she entered the study. He closed the heavy door behind them, shutting out the noise of the party. </p><p> "Thank you, Maury. You look rather lovely yourself." </p><p> He grinned and tugged at the sleeves of his elegant tuxedo. "Evelyn insisted," he said. "I didn't want such an ostentatious send-off. I would have preferred eighteen holes and a quiet lunch at the club with a few friends." </p><p> "And disappoint everyone who wanted to bid you a proper good-bye?" Julia tried keep her voice light, but she couldn't prevent some bitterness from slipping in. "It's not like you to put your golf game ahead of your friends." </p><p> "Now, Julia, don't be like that." He placed a hand at the small of her back and guided her to a soft tapestry-covered sofa in front of the fireplace. "You're going to be well looked after. Your new agent will be able to do more for you than I have these past few years." </p><p> The apology in his voice touched her. "I've had no complaints," Julia said, resting her hand on his arm. "There's no one in this world I trust more than you." </p><p> "Thank you, Julia." Maury cleared his throat and drew out his handkerchief. "That means a lot to me." Abruptly he strode over to his desk, and when his back was turned, Julia watched him fondly as he composed himself. Maury was a good man, one of Hollywood's last true gentlemen. He had been her first husband's oldest and dearest friend. He and his wife, Evelyn, had seen her through Charles's death, and the two foolish marriages and bitter divorces that followed. He had insisted that the producers of <i>Family Tree</i> audition her for the role of Grandma Wilson despite their complaints that she wasn't the right type. He had unraveled hundreds of management snarls and eased countless disappointments throughout the years. Maury was a true friend in a city that knew little of friendship and everything about opportunism and greed. </p><p> He tucked his handkerchief away and picked up a thin stack of papers bound by three gold brads. "What's this?" she asked as he placed the papers in her hands. </p><p> "A little farewell present. You didn't think I'd leave you without one last great project, did you?" </p><p> That was precisely what she had thought, but she wouldn't tell him that. She glanced at the top sheet of the script for the writer's name. "Who's Ellen Henderson? What else has she done?" </p><p> "You won't have heard of her. This is her first major motion picture." </p><p> "Oh, Maury." Julia frowned and tossed the script onto the coffee table. </p><p> He took up the papers and sat down beside her. "Don't 'Oh, Maury' me before you read it. This is the project we've been searching for. It has heart, it has warmth, and it has a fantastic part for you." He placed the script in her lap and closed her hands around it. "Trust me." </p><p> "Who's directing?" </p><p> "Ellen is." </p><p> The alcohol helped flame her temper. "This is your big plan for getting me my breakthrough role? I've won four Emmys and a Golden Globe, and you give me a script written by a nobody. How dare you, after all I've sacrificed?" The last words came out almost as a sob, which she tried to disguise with another sip of champagne. </p><p> Gently Maury took the glass. "Don't hold her inexperience against her. Two years ago her student film won an honorable mention at Sundance. Plus, William Bernier is producing." </p><p> Julia raised her eyebrows at him, her anger forgotten. "I thought he had a three-picture deal with -- " </p><p> "He does. This will be one of those projects. We'll have all the perks and publicity a major studio can provide." </p><p> "That's not bad," Julia admitted, picking up the script. Even if the production fell through, Bernier would remember that she had been willing to take a chance on a neophyte director for his sake. Not every actress of her caliber would take such a risk, and it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a man like Bernier in her debt. </p><p> "I'll leave you alone to read it." Maury patted her knee and rose. "If you don't love it, I promise I'll go out there in front of all those people and tell them I'm canceling my retirement until I can find you the project of your dreams." </p><p> "Don't tempt me," Julia teased as he left the room, though she knew such an announcement would embarrass her more than it would him. </p><p> Alone in the restful silence of the study, she settled back on the sofa and decided to skim through the first few scenes. If nothing else, Maury's script would provide an escape from an evening of phony smiles and niceties and too much rich food. She read the cover page aloud to test the sound of the title. <i>"A Patchwork Life,"</i> she said, and winced. She wanted <i>Masterpiece Theatre,</i> and Maury had given her something so hokey it could have been plucked minutes before from a Midwestern cornfield. If Bernier was half the savvy producer his reputation claimed, he would change that title before releasing a single dollar. Shaking her head and expecting the worst, she turned to the first page and began to read. </p><p></p></p><h2>Essays from the Nick of Time: Reflections and Refutations</h2><p><p><b>A new collection of prophetic essays from one of the sharpest practitioners of the form</b></p><p>Mark Slouka writes from a particular vantage point, one invoked by Thoreau, who wished "to improve the nick of time . . . to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future." At this bewildering convergence, Slouka asks us to consider what it means to be human and what we must revive, or reject, in order to retain our humanity in the modern world. </p><p>Collected over fifteen years, these essays include fascinating explorations of the relationship between memory and history and the nature of "tragedy" in a media-driven culture; meditations on the transcendent "wisdom" of the natural world and the role of silence in an age of noise; and arguments in defense of the political value of leisure time and the importance of the humanities in an age defined by the language of science and industry. Written in Slouka's supple and unerring prose, celebratory, critical, and passionate, <i>Essays from the Nick of Time </i>reawakens us to the moment and place in which we find ourselves, caught between the fading presence of the past and the neon lure of the future.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Slouka</b> is the author of a collection of stories, <i>Lost Lake</i>; a book of nonfiction, <i>War of the Worlds</i>; and two novels, <i>God's Fool </i>and <i>The Visible World</i>. He is a contributing editor to <i>Harper's Magazine </i>and teaches at the University of Chicago.</p>Starred Review. Citing E.B. White's comment on Thoreau, Harper's contributing editor Slouka describes his efforts, as Thoreau did, to navigate the impulse to both celebrate and fix the world. The essays in this powerful collection are divided into two sections: the more personal "Reflections" and the more political "Refutations"--but Slouka is never an either/or writer. In "Blood on the Tracks," for example, he works backwards from a horrific train accident in Connecticut to unravel the lives of the victims, the media's fleeting obsession with tragedy, and his own tenuous connection to the story. "Historical Vertigo," from 2003, juxtaposing time spent in Prague with his first introduction to e-mail, still resonates in an era of text-messaging and Twitter. Some of Slouka's sharpest political barbs are reserved for former President George W. Bush, particularly in "Quitting the Paint Factory" and "Democracy and Deference." But it is perhaps the somber "One Year Later"--written on the first anniversary of September 11 for Harper's--that stands above the rest in this fearless collection as Slouka wrestles with the sense of exceptionalism and lack of historical context that characterized so many Americans' response to tragedy.

Block, a New Yorker born and bred, has penned a paean to the Manhattan he knows and loves, and created a cast of fascinating characters whose lives are touched by the killings. Among the most interesting are a woman whose sexual obsessions ensnare a former police commissioner who's being groomed for higher political office, a crime novelist uncertain about his own culpability in the so-called Carpenter Killings, and a gay housecleaner whose clients keep ending up dead. This may be Block's best novel to date--it's certainly his most erotic and astonishing one, and it will keep you going until the last extraordinary page.

When Union troops discover the brutal massacre of 40 runaway slaves, General Grant worries that abolitionists, endangering the war effort at a particularly critical juncture, will politically exploit the slaughter. Commissioned as Grant's emissary, Jones seeks safe passage across enemy lines to confer with Confederate commanders equally worried that publication of the vile nature of the atrocities will weaken European support for their cause. Teaming up with an aristocratic Southern officer, Jones must cross both physical and emotional borders in order to comprehend the shockingly twisted logic that prompted the senseless bloodletting. In addition to expertly capturing the elegant cadence of Civil War-era dialogue, Parry has also authentically evoked the horror, confusion, and chaos that characterized the conflict between the states. Realistically detailed, bristling with intelligent suspense, and featuring a stoically introspective hero, this superb piece of period fiction will appeal to both Civil War buffs and fans of historical mysteries. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The previous day the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia, impervious to her enemy&#39;s guns, had sunk two Union warships. When she re-emerged from Norfolk to complete the destruction of the Union blockading squadron the USS Monitor steamed out to meet her.

These were smells that once had the power to enthrall him. Now they barely touched him.<br><br>&#x201c;You should step outside,&#x201d; said Madeleine from where she stood at the sink, washing out her cereal bowl. &#x201c;Step out into the sun. It&#x2019;s quite glorious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I can see that,&#x201d; he said, not moving.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit and have your coffee in one of the Adirondack chairs,&#x201d; she said, setting the bowl down in the drying rack on the countertop. &#x201c;You could use some sun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; He nodded meaninglessly and took another sip from the mug he was holding. &#x201c;Is this the same coffee we&#x2019;ve been using?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I �didn&#x2019;t say anything was wrong with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s the same coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>He sighed. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m getting a cold. Last couple of days, things �haven&#x2019;t had much taste.&#x201d;<br><br>She rested her hands on the edge of the sink island and looked at him. &#x201c;You need to get out more. You need to do something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean it. You can&#x2019;t just sit in the house and stare at the wall all day. It will make you sick. It is making you sick. Of course nothing tastes like anything. Have you called Connie Clarke back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When I feel like it.&#x201d;<br><br>He �didn&#x2019;t think it was a feeling he was likely to have in the foreseeable future. �That&#x2019;s just the way he was these �days&#x2014;�the way he&#x2019;d been for the past six months. It was as though, after the injuries he&#x2019;d suffered at the end of the bizarre Jillian Perry murder case, he had withdrawn from everything connected with normal �life&#x2014;�daily tasks, planning, people, phone calls, commitments of any kind. He&#x2019;d gotten to the point where he liked nothing better than a blank calendar page for the coming �month&#x2014;�no appointments, no promises. He&#x2019;d come to equate withdrawal with freedom.<br><br>At the same time, he had the objectivity to know that what was happening to him �wasn&#x2019;t good, that there was no peace in his freedom. His predominant feeling was hostility, not serenity.<br><br>To some extent he understood the strange entropy that was unwinding the fabric of his life and isolating him. Or at least he could list what he believed to be its causes. Near the top of the list he&#x2019;d place the tinnitus he&#x2019;d been experiencing since he emerged from his coma. In all likelihood it had actually begun two weeks before that, when three shots were fired at him in a small room at nearly �point-�blank range.<br><br>The persistent sound in his ears (which the ear, nose, and throat specialist had explained �wasn&#x2019;t a &#x201c;sound&#x201d; at all but rather a neural anomaly that the brain misinterpreted as sound) was hard to describe. The pitch was high, the volume low, the timbre like a softly hissed musical note. The phenomenon was fairly common among rock musicians and combat veterans, was anatomically mysterious, and, apart from occasional cases of spontaneous remission, was generally incurable. &#x201c;Frankly, Detective Gurney,&#x201d; the doctor had concluded, &#x201c;considering what you&#x2019;ve been through, considering the trauma and the coma, ending up with a mild ringing in your ears is a damn lucky outcome.&#x201d;<br><br>It �wasn&#x2019;t a conclusion Dave could argue with. But it �hadn&#x2019;t made it any easier for him to adjust to the faint whine that enveloped him when all else was silent. It was a particular problem at night. What in daylight might resemble the harmless whistling of a teakettle in a distant room became in the darkness a sinister presence, a cold, metallic atmosphere that encased him.<br><br>Then there were the �dreams&#x2014;�claustrophobic dreams that recalled his hospital experiences, memories of the constricting cast that had held his arm immobile, the difficulty he&#x2019;d had in �breathing&#x2014;�dreams that left him feeling panicky for long minutes after awakening.<br><br>He still had a numb spot on his right forearm close to where the first of his assailant&#x2019;s bullets had shattered the wrist bone. He checked the spot regularly, sometimes hourly, in hopes that its numbness was �receding&#x2014;�or, on bleaker days, in fear that it was spreading. There were occasional, unpredictable, stabbing pains in his side where the second bullet had passed through him. There was also an intermittent �tingling&#x2014;�like an itch impervious to �scratching&#x2014;�at the center of his hairline where the third bullet had fractured his skull.<br><br>Perhaps the most distressing effect of being wounded was the constant need he now felt to be armed. He&#x2019;d carried a gun on the job because regulations had required it. Unlike most cops, he had no fondness for firearms. And when he left the department after �twenty-�five years, he left behind, along with his gold detective&#x2019;s shield, the need to carry a weapon.<br><br>Until he was shot.<br><br>And now, each morning as he got dressed, the inevitable final item he put on was a small ankle holster holding a .32 Beretta. He hated the emotional need for it. Hated the change in him that required the damn thing to always be with him. He&#x2019;d hoped the need would gradually diminish, but so far that �wasn&#x2019;t happening.<br><br>On top of everything else, it seemed to him that Madeleine had been watching him in recent weeks with a new kind of worry in her �eyes&#x2014;�not the fleeting looks of pain and panic he&#x2019;d seen in the hospital, or the alternating expressions of hopefulness and anxiety that had accompanied his early recovery, but something quieter and �deeper&#x2014;�a �half-�hidden chronic dread, as if she were witnessing something terrible.<br><br>Still standing by the breakfast table, he finished his coffee in two large swallows. Then he carried the mug to the sink and let the hot water run into it. He could hear Madeleine down the hall in the mudroom, cleaning out the cat&#x2019;s litter box. The cat had recently been added to the household at Madeleine&#x2019;s initiative. Gurney wondered why. Was it to cheer him up? Engage him in the life of a creature other than himself? If so, it �wasn&#x2019;t working. He had no more interest in the cat than in anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to take a shower,&#x201d; he announced.<br><br>He heard Madeleine say something in the mudroom that sounded like &#x201c;Good.&#x201d; He �wasn&#x2019;t sure �that&#x2019;s what she said, but he �didn&#x2019;t see any point in asking. He went into the bathroom and turned on the hot water.<br><br>A long, steamy �shower&#x2014;�the energetic spray pelting his back minute after minute from the base of his neck down to the base of his spine, relaxing muscles, opening capillaries, clearing mind and �sinuses&#x2014;�produced in him a feeling of �well-�being that was both wonderful and fleeting.<br><br>By the time he&#x2019;d dressed again and returned to the French doors, a jangled sense of unease was already beginning to reassert itself. Madeleine was outside now on the bluestone patio. Beyond the patio was the small section of the pasture that had, through two years of frequent mowings, come to resemble a lawn. Clad in a rough barn jacket, orange sweatpants, and green rubber boots, she was working her way along the edge of the flagstones, stamping enthusiastically down on a spade every six inches, creating a clear demarcation, digging out the encroaching roots of the wild grasses. She gave him a look that seemed at first to convey an invitation for him to join in the project, then disappointment at his obvious reluctance to do so.<br><br>Irritated, he purposely looked away, his gaze drifting down the hillside to his green tractor parked by the barn.<br><br>She followed his line of sight. &#x201c;I was wondering, could you use the tractor to smooth out the ruts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ruts?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where we park the cars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure . . .&#x201d; he said hesitantly. &#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It �doesn&#x2019;t have to be done right this minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d; All traces of equanimity from his shower were now gone, as his train of thought shifted to the peculiar tractor problem he&#x2019;d discovered a month ago and had largely put out of his �mind&#x2014;�except for those paranoid moments when it drove him crazy.<br><br>Madeleine appeared to be studying him. She smiled, put down her spade, and walked around to the side door, evidently so she could take off her boots in the mudroom before coming into the kitchen.<br><br>He took a deep breath and stared at the tractor, wondering for the twentieth time about the mysteriously jammed brake. As if acting in malignant harmony, a dark cloud slowly obliterated the sun. Spring, it seemed, had come and gone.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>A Huge Favor for Connie Clarke<br><br>The Gurney property was situated on the saddle of a ridge at the end of a rural road outside the Catskill village of Walnut Crossing. The old farmhouse was set on the gentle southern slope of the saddle. An overgrown pasture separated it from a large red barn and a deep pond ringed by cattails and willows, backed by a beech, maple, and �black-�cherry forest. To the north a second pasture rose along the ridgeline �toward a pine forest and a string of small abandoned bluestone quarries that looked out over the next valley.<br><br>The weather had gone through the kind of dramatic �about-�face that was far more common in the Catskill Mountains than in New York City, where Dave and Madeleine had come from. The sky had become a featureless slaty blanket drawn over the hills. The temperature seemed to have dropped at least ten degrees in ten minutes.<br><br>A superfine sleet was beginning to fall. Gurney closed the French doors. As he pulled them tight to secure the latches, he felt a piercing pain in the right side of his stomach. A moment later another followed. This was something he was used to, nothing that three ibuprofens �couldn&#x2019;t suppress. He headed for the bathroom medicine cabinet, thinking that the worst part of it �wasn&#x2019;t the physical discomfort, the worst part was the feeling of vulnerability, the realization that the only reason he was alive was that he&#x2019;d been lucky.<br><br>Luck was not a concept he liked. It seemed to him to be the �fool&#x2019;s substitute for competence. Random chance had saved his life, but random chance was not a trustworthy ally. He knew younger men who believed in good luck, relied on good luck, thought it was something they owned. But at the age of �forty-�eight, Gurney knew damn well that luck is only luck, and the invisible hand that flips the coin is as cold as a corpse.<br><br>The pain in his side also reminded him that he&#x2019;d been meaning to cancel his upcoming appointment with his neurologist in Binghamton. He&#x2019;d had four appointments with the man in less than four months, and they seemed increasingly pointless, unless the only point was to send Gurney&#x2019;s insurance company another bill.<br><br>He kept that phone number with his other medical numbers in his den desk. Instead of continuing into the bathroom for the ibuprofen, he went into the den to make the call. As he was entering the number, he was picturing the doctor: a preoccupied man in his late thirties, with wavy black hair already receding, small eyes, girlish mouth, weak chin, silky hands, manicured fingernails, expensive loafers, dismissive manner, and no visible interest in anything that Gurney thought or felt. The three women who inhabited his sleek, contemporary reception area seemed perpetually confused and irritated by the doctor, by his patients, and by the data on their computer screens.<br><br>The phone was answered on the fourth ring with an impatience verging on contempt. &#x201c;Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s office.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is David Gurney, I have an upcoming appointment that �I&#x2019;d&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>The sharp voice cut him off. &#x201c;Hold on, please.&#x201d;<br><br>In the background he could hear a raised male voice that he thought for a moment belonged to an angry patient reeling off a long, urgent �complaint&#x2014;�until a second voice asked a question and a third voice joined the fray in a similar tone of loud, �fast-�talking �indignation&#x2014;�and Gurney realized that what he was hearing was the cable news channel that made sitting in Huffbarger&#x2019;s waiting room insufferable.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; said Gurney with a definite edge. &#x201c;Anybody there? Hello?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a minute, please.&#x201d;<br><br>The voices that he found so abrasively �empty-�headed continued in the background. He was about to hang up when the receptionist&#x2019;s voice returned.<br><br>&#x201c;Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s office, can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. This is David Gurney. I have an appointment I want to cancel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The date?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A week from today at �eleven-�forty a.m.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spell your name, please.&#x201d;<br><br>He was about to question how many people had appointments on that same day at 11:40, but he spelled his name instead.<br><br>&#x201c;And when do you wish to reschedule it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just canceling it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to reschedule it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can reschedule Dr. Huffbarger&#x2019;s appointments, not cancel them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the fact �is&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>She interrupted, sounding exasperated. &#x201c;An existing appointment can&#x2019;t be removed from the system without inserting a revised date. �That&#x2019;s the doctor&#x2019;s policy.&#x201d;<br><br>Gurney could feel his lips tightening with anger, way too much anger. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t �really care much about his system or his policy,&#x201d; he said slowly, stiffly. &#x201c;Consider my appointment canceled.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There will be a �missed-�appointment charge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No there won&#x2019;t. And if Huffbarger has a problem with that, tell him to call me.&#x201d; He hung up, tense, feeling a twinge of chagrin at his childish twisting of the neurologist&#x2019;s name.<br><br>He stared out the den window at the high pasture without �really seeing it.<br><br>What the �hell&#x2019;s the matter with me?<br><br>A jab of pain in his right side offered a partial answer.

Cl�ment, a French feminist philosopher, has written an intensely subjective meditation on the unhappy fate of women in opera. The result is often infuriating, sometimes enlightening. <p> Cl�ment is an enthusiast whose passion for opera struggles with revulsion at much of its content. Critics are dry, remote--and male. She prefers a poetic, Freudian approach that leaves out something crucial to her argument: cultural context. The grim choices historically available to women haven't been peculiar to opera: murder, suicide, disease, and madness have also been their lot in drama and the novel. Perhaps it's Western civilization that has been the undoing of women. </p><p> Cl�ment finds the experience of the opera house almost too powerful. Here she examines texts with an awareness not "dimmed by beauty and the sublime," an exercise that has a cumulative effect. She highlights the social framework of plots otherwise exalted by music: in <i>La Boh�me</i>, a bitter tale of freezing poverty; in <i>Tosca</i>, a heroine who acts against a police state; in <i>The Magic Flute</i>, a battle of the sexes told by the winning side (i.e., male). But <i>La Fanciulla del West</i>, with a victorious central character, has never been as popular: "Opera lovers do not like this antiheroine. She is made for tomorrow." </p><p> By the lengthy final chapter, on the <i>Ring</i> cycle, the author has relaxed her argument. She casts an eye on both male and female, on the themes of love, incest, and the triumph of human over god. Her ecstatic response to the cycle's music--not to mention the gender-indiscriminate "undoing"--lays her conflict with opera to rest. She is, as she says elsewhere, "silenced by emotion."</p><p> Cl�ment's writing, in Betsy Wing's deft translation, is amusing and unacademic. Her readings entertain without always persuading--or even involving--the reader. In that way, the book evokes Wayne Koestenbaum's <i>The Queen's Throat</i>, another case of a sensibility run rampant. Like that book, <i>The Undoing of Women</i> can inspire fruitful thoughts despite its own perverseness. <i>--David Olivenbaum</i></p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>World of Reading: Doc McStuffins Blame It on the Rain: Level 1</h2><p>In this Level 1 reader, Alma&#39;s stuffed cow, Moo Moo, gets soaked when she is left outside in the rain.

Her mother was a magazine illustrator, while her father was a political cartoonist. Illustration was Enright&#39;s original career choice and she studied art in Greenwich, Connecticut; Paris, France; and New York City. After creating her first book in 1935, she developed a taste, and quickly demonstrated a talent, for writing. Throughout her life, she won many awards, including the 1939 John Newbery Medal for Thimble Summer and a 1958 Newbery Honor for Gone-Away Lake. Among her other beloved titles are her books about the Melendy family, including &#34;The Saturdays&#34;, published in 1941. Enright also wrote short stories for adults, and her work was published in &#34;The New Yorker&#34;, &#34;The Ladies Home Journal&#34;, &#34;Cosmopolitan&#34;, &#34;The Yale Review&#34;, &#34;Harper s&#34;, and &#34;The Saturday Evening Post&#34;.

The Love That Satisfies is for all whether married, single, or religious who are seeking the face of true love in a wounded world.</p> <p>Are we to agree with the Beatles that All You Need is Love or with the J. Geils Band that Love Stinks ? That would depend, of course, on what we mean by that slippery four-letter word L-O-V-E. In The Love That Satisfies, Christopher West turns to the wisdom of both Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II in order to shed some light on sexual love (eros) and its relationship with divine love (agape).</p> <p>Why is the love between man and woman so attractive and elusive, demanding and rewarding, restrictive and liberating, painful and ecstatic, messy and beautiful, maddening and fulfilling? Our world is saturated with sex but remains starved for love. Why? Perhaps as Waylon Jennings put it, we re Lookin' for love in all the wrong places, lookin' for love in too many faces. Where, then, is the right place and whose, then, is the right face in which to look for love?</p> <p>By reflecting on key passages from Pope Benedict s grand encyclical Deus Caritas Est, this book explores these and many other questions with the goal of pointing all who read it towards the love that satisfies. Those who give Pope Benedict s teaching the attention it deserves will discover that the Catholic Church has a vision of sexual love far more glorious than anything Sigmund Freud, Hugh Hefner, Britney Spears, or Howard Stern could dream of or imagine. You doubt? This book will make you a believer.</p></p><p>Christopher West is recognized around the globe for his work promoting an integral, biblical vision of human life, love, and sexuality. He serves as a research fellow and faculty member of the Theology of the Body Institute near Philadelphia. He has also lectured on a number of other prestigious faculties, offering graduate and undergraduate courses at St. John Vianney Seminary in Denver, the John Paul II Institute in Melbourne, Australia, and the Institute for Priestly Formation at Creighton University in Omaha. <p>In addition, Christopher is the best-selling author of several books, including <i>Theology of the Body for Beginners, Good News About Sex and Marriage,</i> and <i>Heaven s Song,</i> and is also one of the most sought-after speakers in the Church today. Christopher and his wife, Wendy, live with their children near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p></p><h2>War Against the Family: A Parent Speaks Out</h2><p>A parent speaks out on the political, economic, and social policies that threaten us all</p><p></p><h2>Beyond Brawn, Revised</h2><p><b>What if you had access to the mother lode revelation of the lies, myths, drugs, rip-off food supplements, and irresponsible training instruction that has long blighted the bodybuilding world?</b><b></b><b>&nbsp;<br>And what if you had access to the mother lode revelation of how to build lots of muscle and strength without great genetics, without steroids, and without having to train four or more times a week?</b><b></b><b>&nbsp;<br>Imagine the power you would have to build a bigger leaner body.</b><b></b><b>&nbsp;<br>But don't just imagine this.

He lay in bed for two weeks wondering if he would ever see again. When his sight miraculously returned, Muir resolved to devote all his time to the great passion of his life -- studying plants. He quit his job in an Indiana manufacturing plant, said good-bye to his family, and set out alone to walk to the Gulf of Mexico, sketching tropical plants along the way. He kept a journal of this thousand-mile walk and near the end of his life, now famous as a conservation warrior and literary celebrity, sent a typescript of it to his publisher. The result is a wonderful portrait of a young man in search of himself and a particularly vivid portrait of the post-war American South. Here is the young Muir talking with freed slaves and former Confederate soldiers, pondering the uses of electricity, exploring Mammoth Cave, sleeping in a Savannah cemetery, delirious with malarial fever in the home of strangers at Cedar Key, traveling to Havana, Cuba, and sailing to San Francisco Bay. Once in California, Muir promptly set out for Yosemite Valley -- 200 miles away. There Muir found his destiny -- and a mountain range to test his apparently inexhaustible capacity for walking. A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf bridges two Muir classics: The Story of My Boyhood and Youth and My First Summer in the Sierra.&nbsp;John Muir (1838-1914) was one of the most influential conservationists and nature writers in American history. Founder of the Sierra Club, and its president until his death, Muir was a spirit so free that all he did to prepare for an expedition was to &#34;throw some tea and bread into an old sack and jump the back fence.&#34;</p><h2>Tully</h2><p>Five young Midwestern women and men struggle to find their paths in the wake of a shared and life-altering tragedy</p><p>Paullina Simons was born in Leningrad in 1963. As a child she emigrated to Queens, New York, and attended colleges in Long Island. Then she moved to England and attended Essex University, before returning to America. She lives in New York with her husband and children.Esteemed editor Bob Wyatt's initial book for his new imprint, this much ballyhooed first novel is not notable for literary merit but for the melodramatic story it tells. Set during the last two decades in Topeka, Kans., and centering on a tough kid named Tully who oddly resembles skater Tonya Harding in looks and deportment, the narrative chronicles Tully's wild struggle against her lower-class origins, circumstances and fate (not to mention her genes) without any redeeming growth or insights achieved by any of the central characters until at the end Tully belatedly realizes the error of her ways. It's an emotionally crude coming-of-age story in which Tully, her two best girlfriends and the two men she loves never seem to rise above adolescent emotions and behavior. The story has the no-holds-barred, cranked-out quality of 19th-century penny novels, with an abundance of cheap thrills and hair-raising scenes. We tag along as Tully endures abandonment, incest, abortion, child and spousal abuse, passion, promiscuity, marriage, motherhood, infidelity, terrible nightmares, midnight graveyard scenes, tortured partings with lovers and more. The most interesting character is the villain, Hedda Makker, Tully's mother, whose chief pleasure in life is beating the living daylights out of Tully. Though billed as "a big Russian novel" about mothers and daughters, much of the narrative has a breathless, awkward oral texture, although long patches of exposition have an evenness and clarity that suggest Simons's potential. Despite all the wailing, sighing and bloodletting--or perhaps because of it--the story is engrossing as tabloid features often are: not believeable or artful, but fascinating in a macabre way. 165,000 first printing; $150,000 ad/promo; BOMC selection . <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Essential Pruning Techniques: Trees, Shrubs, and Conifers</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Walks any would-be arborist through a veritable dictionary of trees, from abelias to zenobias.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> Pruning is an indispensable part of garden maintenance, but it is also one of the most difficult.

A winner of the National Book Award, the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, and countless other honors, he has persistently crossed the lines of class and race, first as a teacher, then as the author of tender and heart-breaking books about the children he has called &#x201c;the outcasts of our nation&#x2019;s ingenuity.&#x201d; But Jonathan is not a distant and detached reporter. His own life has been radically transformed by the children who have trusted and befriended him.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never has this intimate acquaintance with his subjects been more apparent, or more stirring, than in <i>Fire in the Ashes</i>, as Jonathan tells the stories of young men and women who have come of age in one of the most destitute communities of the United States. Some of them never do recover from the battering they undergo in their early years, but many more battle back with fierce and, often, jubilant determination to overcome the formidable obstacles they face. As we watch these glorious children grow into the fullness of a healthy and contributive maturity, they ignite a flame of hope, not only for themselves, but for our society.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The urgent issues that confront our urban schools &#x2013; a devastating race-gap, a pathological regime of obsessive testing and drilling students for exams instead of giving them the rich curriculum that excites a love of learning &#x2013; are interwoven through these stories. Why certain children rise above it all, graduate from high school and do well in college, while others are defeated by the time they enter adolescence, lies at the essence of this work.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan Kozol is the author of <i>Death at an Early Age</i>, <i>Savage Inequalities</i>, and other books on children and their education. He has been called &#x201c;today&#x2019;s most eloquent spokesman for America&#x2019;s disenfranchised.&#x201d; But he believes young people speak most eloquently for themselves; and in this book, so full of the vitality and spontaneity of youth, we hear their testimony.</p></p><p>Jonathan Kozol is the National Book Award-winning author of <i>Savage Inequalities</i>, <i>Death at an Early Age</i>, <i>The Shame of the Nation</i>, and <i>Amazing Grace</i>.&nbsp; He has been working with children in inner-city schools for nearly fifty years.Chapter 1<br><br>The Journey Begins<br><br>Christmas Eve of 1985 was not a good time for poor women and their children to depend on public kindness or prophetic reenactments of the Christian gospel at the hands of civic and commercial leaders in New York. It was a time when opulence among the city&#x2019;s newly minted rich and super-rich was flaunted with an unaccustomed boldness in the face of New York City&#x2019;s poor and homeless people, thousands of whom were packed into decrepit, drug-infested shelters, most of which were old hotels situated in the middle of Manhattan, some of which in decades past had been places of great elegance.<br><br>One of the largest shelters was the Martinique Hotel, across the street from Macy&#x2019;s and one block from Fifth Avenue. In this building, 1,400 children and about 400 of their parents struggled to prevail within a miserable warren of bleak and squalid rooms that offered some, at least, protection from the cold of winter, although many rooms in which I visited with families in the last week of December were so poorly heated that the children huddled beneath blankets in the middle of the day and some wore mittens when they slept.<br><br>I remember placing calls on freezing nights from phone booths on Sixth Avenue or Broadway trying to reach Steven Banks, a Legal Aid attorney who performed innumerable rescue actions for the families in the Martinique that year. The wind that cut across the open space of Herald Square at night was fierce, the sidewalks felt like slabs of ice, and kids and parents from the Martinique who had to venture out for milk or bread or medicines would bundle up as best they could in layers of old clothes and coats, if they did have coats, or sweatshirts with the hoods drawn tight around their chins.<br><br>Dozens of kids I knew within the building suffered from chronic colds. Many were also racked by asthma and bronchitis. Infants suffered from diarrhea. Sleepless parents suffered from depression. Mothers wept in front of me.<br><br>I had never seen destitution like this in America before. Twenty years earlier, I had taught young children in the black community of Boston and had organized slum tenants there and lived within their neighborhood and had been in many homes where rats cohabited with children in their bedrooms. But sickness, squalor, and immiseration on the scale I was observing now were virtually unknown to me.<br><br>Almost every child that I came to know that winter in the Martinique was hungry. On repeated evenings when I went to interview a family I gave up asking questions when a boy or girl would eye the denim shoulder bag I used to carry, in which I often had an apple or some cookies or a box of raisins, and would give them what I had. Sometimes I would ask if I could look into the small refrigerators that the hotel had reluctantly provided to the families. Now and then I&#x2019;d find a loaf of bread or several slices of bologna or a slice or two of pizza that had gone uneaten from the day before. Often there was nothing but a shriveled piece of fruit, a couple of jars of apple sauce, a tin of peanut butter, sometimes not even that.<br><br>I continued visiting the Martinique throughout the next two years. During that time, a play about impoverished children of the nineteenth century in Paris, called Les Miserables, opened to acclaim in the theater district of New York. Some of the more enterprising children in the Martinique would walk the twelve or fifteen blocks between the hotel and the theater district in late afternoons or evenings to panhandle in the streets around the theater or in front of restaurants nearby. Homeless women did this too, as well as many of the homeless men, some alcoholics and some mentally unwell, who slept in cardboard boxes on the sidewalks and in doorways of the buildings in the area.<br><br>The presence of these homeless people was not welcomed by the theater owners. People were paying a great deal of money to enjoy an entertainment fashioned from the misery of children of another era. The last thing that they wanted was to come out of the theater at the end and be obliged to see real children begging on the sidewalk right in front of them.<br><br>The problem was resolved to some degree when police and private guards employed by local businesses developed strategies for cleaning out the homeless--sanitation terms like &#x201c;cleaning out&#x201d; were used without embarrassment--from the streets around the theaters. Meanwhile, on the East Side of Manhattan, another group of business leaders went a little further by employing people in the homeless population to drive out other homeless people from Grand Central Station, where they had been taking refuge from the cold for several years by sleeping in the station&#x2019;s waiting rooms.<br><br>The ultimate solution, which required the removal of these homeless families from the midtown sections of Manhattan altogether, took a few more years to carry out successfully. In the interim, despite the efforts of the theater owners, many of the older children from the Martinique would manage to slip past the hired guards or the police and walk up to theater-goers, who would sometimes hand them a few dollars.<br><br>The younger children from the Martinique, however, did their begging for the most part close to home within the blocks surrounding the hotel, where they would run into the streets when drivers slowed their cars as the lights were changing and where a driver whose compassion overcame his irritation might roll down his window far enough to give the kids some money. Those who were inclined to castigate the parents of these children for letting them go out into the streets at night might have relented somewhat if they understood how rapidly the competence of many of these parents had come to be eroded by the harshness of conditions in that building.<br><br>Scenarios of broken will and loss of good decision-making skills were apparent everywhere. Some of the parents were emotionally ill when they arrived here; but those who weren&#x2019;t would frequently succumb to the pervasive atmosphere of insecurity and high anxiety that suffused the filthy corridors and crowded living spaces of the Martinique. Many who had not used drugs before this time became drug users in a setting in which heroin and crack cocaine were readily available. (The sixteenth floor of the Martinique Hotel--there were seventeen floors in all, but the top two were unoccupied--was operated, with the knowledge and, apparently, cooperation of some of the guards, as an open market for drug users.) A number of people became HIV-infected under these conditions, although in 1985 the term was not yet widely recognized among some of the residents and many did not understand exactly why it was that they were growing ill.<br><br>The conditions under which these people had to live were not unknown to New York City&#x2019;s social service system or to its political administration. Anybody who was able to get past the guards, as I did repeatedly with the cooperation of two sympathetic social workers who enabled me to get into the upper floors and visit families pretty much at will, could not avoid, unless he closed his eyes, the sight of overflowing garbage piled in the landings and of children who, for lack of other options, played amidst that garbage.<br><br>But physical unhealthiness, the prevalence of drug addiction, and the documented presence of widely known carcinogens (open containers of asbestos, for example, and asbestos-coated pipes in the lobby of the building) were not the worst of the destructive forces children and their families had to undergo. The Martinique, as I was forced to recognize when the social workers started talking candidly to me during the months to come, was not merely a despairing place, diseased and dangerous for those who had no choice but to remain there; it also was a place of flagrant and straightforward criminality on the part of management and ownership. A young man with a raw, salacious smile, to whom the social workers made it a special point to introduce me and who, they told me, was a relative of one of the two owners of the building, used the power he was thus afforded to induce young women to provide him with erotic favors in exchange for items that they needed, such as cribs and linens for their children.<br><br>&#x201c;He boasts about it,&#x201d; one of the two social workers told me. &#x201c;He describes it to us openly, and gleefully. He goes into considerable detail. . . .&#x201d; Some of the guards, the social worker said, took advantage of the younger mothers too, as one of those mothers, a smart and savvy woman who told me she had had to fight off their advances, reported to me at the time and has repeated since.<br><br>There was no need for secrecy, it seemed, because there was a sense that this was &#x201c;a closed system,&#x201d; where rules of normal law and normal governance did not apply. Complaint or protest would have no effect except to prompt the guards or manager to punish the complaining woman by denying her essential services or else, if the manager so wished, by calling the police and charging her with one of many forms of misbehavior that were common in a building in which almost every person had to break some rule or operate some petty scam in order to survive.<br><br>Cooking, for example, was officially prohibited because of fire dangers, but the city&#x2019;s meager allocation of subsistence funds to purchase food made it unthinkable to buy it from a restaurant and forced the mothers in the Martinique to cook their children&#x2019;s meals in secret, then conceal their hot plates when inspectors from the city came around. The management cooperated with the tenants by providing them with garbage bags to cover up the hot plates on inspection days while, at the same time, it pretended not to know that this was going on. When mothers were reluctant to provide the guards who were hired to protect them with the favors they expected, the guards could use the cooking scam or other scams much like it as a way to break down their resistance.<br><br>Children, of course, observed the humiliation of their mothers. The little ones, too young to go to school, might perhaps be sent out to the corridors; but most of the mothers would not dare to let them wander too far from the bedroom door. Even the kids who never witnessed these activities first-hand could not fail to be aware of them. I used to wonder what enduring influence all of this would have upon the capability of children in the building to believe in any kind of elemental decency in people who have power over their existence. Would they later find it hard to trust the teachers in their public schools? Would they develop an endemic wariness about investing faith in any older person of authority? Would they love their mothers all the more for having done the best they could to protect them from this nightmare, or would they harbor a resentment that their mothers were not able to avoid this situation in the first place?<br><br>One of the social workers who befriended me that year, a sensitive man who had studied early childhood development as an undergraduate at Yale, spoke of the Martinique in unsparing language as &#x201c;New York City&#x2019;s midtown death camp for the spirits of poor children.&#x201d; He knew that I was Jewish and he asked me later if this choice of language had offended me. I told him it did not. I thought it was justified.<br><br>Two years later, I published a book about the Martinique Hotel. It appeared first in two successive issues of The New Yorker magazine, and this, in turn, attracted interest from the other media. The Nightline television program, moderated at the time by the journalist Ted Koppel, asked me to go back into the Martinique with a camera crew and do a documentary on the families I had known. The social workers and some of the mothers helped to get the camera crew and the producer past the guards and up into the building. The camera itself was hidden in a baby carriage by one of the mothers, who rolled it through the lobby without attracting scrutiny and brought it with her on an elevator to the floor where she was living. She then accompanied us into other bedrooms whose occupants had told me they were not afraid to answer questions.<br><br>By the time we had finished with the final interview, however, a guard on an upper floor had become suspicious, banged at the door, which we did not open, then notified the management. The manager, an unpleasant character by the name of Sal Tuccelli who carried a pistol in an ankle holster, confronted us with several other guards and insisted that the cameramen hand over the material they had just recorded. When they refused, the manager and guards reacted in the same way they routinely did with residents who defied or disobeyed them. I was slammed against a metal wall. One of the cameramen was seriously injured. The TV producer, an unintimidated woman, removed one of her high-heel shoes and used it to defend us. By this point, the police had been alerted. The cameramen got out of the building with the video.<br><br>I knew, of course, that journalists were not welcome in the building and that the social workers who had made my visits possible were taking risks in doing so. But until this time I had never witnessed so directly the extremes to which the management would go in the interest of concealment. It reminded me more vividly than ever that the city and the owners of the Martinique, with whom the city had contracted to sequester homeless people at a price tag of $8 million yearly for those 400 families, were determined to discourage any troublesome exposure of the social crime in which they were colluding.<br><br>It also left me with a visceral reminder of the terror mothers and their children would experience when the guards or, more frequently, the manager would hammer at their doors early in the morning if, for example, the rental check paid by the city, through no fault of their own, had not arrived on time. &#x201c;Six a.m.,&#x201d; one of the mothers told me. &#x201c;He bangs on the door. You open up. There he is in the hallway with his gun. &#x2018;Where&#x2019;s your rent?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>This is the way that one of the richest cities in the world treated the most vulnerable children in its midst a quarter century ago. When these hotels were finally closed in 1988 and 1989, not for reasons of compassion but because of the enormous damage the visibility of so much desperation was doing to the image of the city and its elected leaders, most of the several dozen families I had come to know, all but two of whom were black or Latino, were shipped en masse into several of the most impoverished and profoundly segregated sections of the Bronx, far from the sight of tourists and the media. These were communities that already had the city&#x2019;s highest rates of HIV infection, the greatest concentration of drug-addicted people, of people who had serious psychiatric illnesses, women with diabetes, women with undiagnosed malignancies, and among the highest rates of pediatric asthma in the nation.</p><h2>Full of Beans</h2><p>Citing the nutritional and low-fat benefits of beans, a collection of flexible recipes highlights such dishes as Low Country Hoppin&#39; John, Red Beans &#39;n&#39; Rice, and All-American Bourbon-Spiked Baked Beans.

What resulted is this book: an honest, intelligent, no-holds-barred discussion of virtually every &#x201c;hot button&#x201d; issue on which Reform and Orthodox Jews differ, among them the existence of a Supreme Being, the origins and authenticity of the Bible and the Oral Law, the role of women, assimilation, the value of secular culture, and Israel.<br><br>Sometimes they agree; more often than not they disagree&#x2014;and quite sharply, too. But the important thing is that, as they keep talking to each other, they discover that they actually like each other, and, above all, they respect each other. Their journey from mutual suspicion to mutual regard is an extraordinary one; from it, both Jews and non-Jews of all backgrounds can learn a great deal about the practice of Judaism today and about the continuity of the Jewish people into the future.</p><p>"The dialogue between Hirsch and Reinman proves the essential unity of the Jewish people. While bringing vastly different approaches and beliefs to this wide-ranging debate on various aspects of Judaism and the Jewish world, they share the national Jewish consciousness and deep commitment to the heritage of the Jewish people that unites all streams of Judaism. If the State of Israel is to preserve its national Jewish identity, there must be freedom for all the main streams of Judaism to follow their beliefs and practices in order to achieve our common goal--to bring all Jews closer to Judaism and the Jewish people." <br>--Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, Israel <br><br>"<i>One People, Two Worlds </i>provokes, stimulates, angers, delights, and ultimately makes you think hard about what you believe and value. I found myself joining the discussion, sometimes agreeing with Hirsch, sometimes with Reinman, often arguing with both.

The CD contains an index in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format which contains thumbnails of all the images and the images themselves are TIFFs (suitable for PCs or Macs) in a separate folder. Since we are encouraged to browse using, for example, Windows Explorer, the purpose of the PDF index is not clear. This CD contained 90-odd images. Reproduction of the images is permitted but not for commercial use - fair enough. The images themselves are large and, although readable in newer paint programs, we experienced difficulty testing Paint Shop Pro versions earlier than 8. Since many people still use version 7, this may lead to problems. The answer is to read the desired image in Windows Paint and re-save it (still as TIFF). This CDROM is a good idea, especially for those of us who design on the computer. The images are clear and prove a good starting point for design.

McGeorge<br> Illustrations by Mary Whyte</b><br> <br> </p><p>BOOKLIST <br> SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL<br> KIRKUS REVIEWS </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b>FROM: BOOKLIST<br> By Lauren Peterson</b><br> Boomer, the spunky golden retriever who starred in <i>Boomer's Big Day</i> (1994) and <i>Boomer Goes to School</i> (1996), is back in a new adventure. This time he gets a new dog sibling and has most of the same feelings young children have when there's a new baby in the house. First, Boomer is confused. Why is Baby eating when it isn't dinnertime yet? Then the green-eyed monster rears its head as Boomer watches Baby playing with Boomer's favorite toy and getting a belly rub. But just when Boomer is beginning to wonder whether anyone will ever play with him again, he feels a lick on his nose. It isn't long before Boomer and Baby are off and running with Boomer leading the way. This delightful series may use a lovable family dog to play out common childhood events, but children will relate to Boomer's experience as easily as they would to a child's. Whyte, who actually owns a golden retreiver named Boomer, has done another fine job depicting the action in flowing watercolors. A worthwhiie addition to a fine series. </p><p><br> <b>FROM: SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL</b><b> <br> By Martha Topol</b><br> Boomer's canine reactions provide insight into the new sibling experience. His expressions of curiousity and dejected concern will garner sympathy from readers and allow them to seet he pains and rewards that accompany any addtion to a family. Following the lead of the text, the watercolor illustrations give a dog's-eye view of the world. Soft and pleasing, they make the most of the inherent cuteness of a golden retriever puppy. Delightful and emotionally satisfying. </p><p><br> <b>FROM: KIRKUS REVIEWS</b><br> Using unembellished language and plain sentence structure, the narrator reports Boomer's feelings, "Later, everyone went outside to play. Boomer was very excited...He waited and waited for someone to throw him the ball. But no one did." Baby wins Boomer over with a wag of the tail and a lick of the nose, enlisting the older dog in play. The crowning moment is a spread showing Boomer as onlooker to the new puppy's masterpiece a paw-printed living room with a chewed-up shoe, knocked-over plant, and spilling goldfish bowl. The affectionate watercolors will find their audience in dog lovers and children with new siblings alike. </p><p></p></p><h2>China&#39;s Last Empire: The Great Qing (History of Imperial China)</h2><p><p> In a brisk revisionist history, William Rowe challenges the standard narrative of Qing China as a decadent, inward-looking state that failed to keep pace with the modern West. </p><p> </p><p> The Great Qing was the second major Chinese empire ruled by foreigners. Three strong Manchu emperors worked diligently to secure an alliance with the conquered Ming gentry, though many of their social edicts&#x2014;especially the requirement that ethnic Han men wear queues&#x2014;were fiercely resisted. As advocates of a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; empire, Qing rulers also achieved an enormous expansion of the Chinese realm over the course of three centuries, including the conquest and incorporation of Turkic and Tibetan peoples in the west, vast migration into the southwest, and the colonization of Taiwan. </p><p> </p><p> Despite this geographic range and the accompanying social and economic complexity, the Qing ideal of &#x201c;small government&#x201d; worked well when outside threats were minimal. But the nineteenth-century Opium Wars forced China to become a player in a predatory international contest involving Western powers, while the devastating uprisings of the Taiping and Boxer rebellions signaled an urgent need for internal reform. Comprehensive state-mandated changes during the early twentieth century were not enough to hold back the nationalist tide of 1911, but they provided a new foundation for the Republican and Communist states that would follow. </p><p> </p><p> This original, thought-provoking history of China&#x2019;s last empire is a must-read for understanding the challenges facing China today. </p></p><p>William T. Rowe is John and Diane Cooke Professor of Chinese History at Johns Hopkins University.In a fine, well-written study, Rowe brings the latest scholarship in Qing history to a wide audience. This book reflects a lifetime of reading in the field, and is written in the fluent manner of an accomplished and very successful author. Responsible and judicious, it makes an important contribution to our understanding of Chinese history. (R. Kent Guy, University of Washington)<br><br>Here is a new narrative for Chinese history. It is based on the path-breaking scholarship of a small body of principally American scholars who have shown that after the non-Han Manchus conquered the Ming in 1644, traditional China was gradually replaced by something very different. This meant that the previous explanations, emanating from the Harvard school, led by the persuasive John King Fairbank, which emphasized a succession of essentially unchanging dynasties, must be abandoned...In short, as Professor Rowe sets out in this important book, "the inward-looking and hermetic Celestial Empire" has vanished and something far more interesting has come convincingly before us.

Its leader is perpetually on the verge of death. And on top of that, a new drug has just entered circulation &#x2015; a drug that haphazardly sends its users traveling through time. In an attempt to escape his doomed marriage, Dr. Eric Sweetscent becomes caught up in all of it. But he has questions: Is Earth on the right side of the war? Is he supposed to heal Earth&#x2019;s leader or keep him sick? And can he change the harrowing future that the drug has shown him?</p><p>Dr. Eric Sweetscent has problems. His planet is enmeshed in an unwinnable war. His wife is lethally addicted to a drug that whips its users helplessly back and forth across time -- and is hell-bent on making Eric suffer along with her.

Born to a printing family in the small foothill town of Saluzzo, he left his comfortable life to travel to Rome in 1758 where he served as an apprentice of Cardinal Spinelli at the Propaganda Fide press. There, under the sponsorship of Ruggieri, his close friend, mentor, and protector, he learned all aspects of the printing craft. Even then, his real talent, indeed his genius, lay in type design and punchcutting, especially of the exotic foreign alphabets needed by the papal office to spread the faith.</p><p>His life changed when in 1768 at age 28 he was invited by the young Duke of Parma to abandon Rome for that very French city to establish and direct the ducal press. He remained in Parma, overseeing a vast variety of printing, some of it pedestrian, but much of it glorious. And all of it making use of the typefaces he personally designed and engraved.</p><p>This fine book goes beyond Bodoni's capacity as a printer; it examines the life and times in which he lived, the turbulent and always fragile political climate, the fascinating cast of characters that enlivened the ducal court, the impressive list of visitors making the pilgrim- age to Parma, and the unique position Parma occupied, politically Italian but very much French in terms of taste and culture. Even the food gets its due (and in savory detail). The illustrations-of the city, of the press, of the types and matrices-are compelling enough, but most striking are the pages from the books he designed. And especially, pages from his typographic masterpiece, the Manuale Tipografico, painstakingly prepared by his wife Ghitta, posthumously published in two volumes, and displaying the myriad typefaces in multiple sizes that Bodoni had designed and engraved over a long and prolific career.</p><p>Intriguing, scholarly, visually arresting, and designed and printed to Bodoni's standards, this title belongs on the shelf of any self-respecting bibliophile. It not only makes for compelling reading, it will be considered the biography of record of a great printer for years to come.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><b><i>Valerie Browne Lester</i></b> is an independent scholar, writer, and translator living in Boston.

By using $100 million as bait and spinning a deadly web of corruption, forgery, and terror, Saddam Hussein seeks to embarrass the U.S. with the ultimate revenge: to steal a treasured historical document and then destroy it before the world's media -- on July 4, 1994.<p>As the countdown to Independence day begins, two agents stand in the way of his nearly flawless plan: Scott Bradley, a rising star in the CIA who is desperate to prove his patriotism, and Hannah Kopec, the stunning Mossad operative who has already lost so much that she fears nothing and trusts no one.

However, it was her nude scene, and surprising dramatic ability, in Ecstasy that made her a star. Ecstasy&#x2019;s notoriety followed her for the rest of her life. She married one of Austria&#x2019;s most successful and wealthy munitions barons, giving up her career for what seemed at first a fairy-tale existence. Instead, as war clouds loomed in the mid-1930s, Hedy discovered that she was trapped in a loveless marriage to a controlling, ruthless man who befriended Mussolini, sold armaments to Hitler, yet hid his own Jewish heritage to become an &#x201c;honorary Aryan.&#x201d; </p><p>She fled her husband and escaped to Hollywood, where M-G-M changed her name to Hedy Lamarr and she became one of film&#x2019;s most glamorous stars. She worked with such renowned directors as King Vidor, Victor Fleming, and Cecil B. DeMille, and appeared opposite such respected actors&nbsp;as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, John Garfield, and James Stewart. But as her career waned, her personal problems and legal wranglings cast lingering shadows over her former image. It wasn&#x2019;t until decades later that the world was stunned to learn of her&nbsp;unexpected role as the inventor of a technology that has become an essential part of everything from military weaponry&nbsp;to cell phones&#x2014;proof that Hedy Lamarr was far more than merely Delilah to Victor Mature&#x2019;s Samson. She demonstrated a creativity and an intelligence she had always possessed. </p>Stephen Michael Shearer&#x2019;s in-depth and meticulously researched biography, written with the cooperation of Hedy&#x2019;s children, intimate friends, and colleagues, separates the truths from the&nbsp;rumors, the facts from the fables, about Hedy Lamarr, to reveal the life and character of one of classic Hollywood&#x2019;s most beautiful and remarkable women.</p><p><p>STEPHEN MICHAEL SHEARER is the author of <i>Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life</i>. He has written for the <i>Las Vegas Review-Journal </i>and is also a former model and actor, having appeared on stage, television, and in film. Shearer currently resides in Minnesota and New York City.</p>In this authoritative biography, Shearer (Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life) surveys the career of actress Hedy Lamarr (1913-2000), born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in Vienna. In her teens, she was cast in German films, and in 1933, after she appeared nude in Ecstasy, she was catapulted to international fame. During an Atlantic crossing on the Normandie, Louis B. Mayer offered her an MGM contract and changed her name to Hedy Lamarr. Promoted as "the most beautiful girl in the world," she appeared in more than two dozen films between 1938 and 1958. Metro denied her a loan out to do the lead in Casablanca, but her vibrant screen presence in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah (1949) left a lasting impression on both filmgoers and Paramount; it raked in over million to become the most profitable Paramount production up until that time. She faded from films in the 1950s, made numerous 1960s TV appearances and then dropped from the limelight, retiring to Florida in 1987. Providing probing and detailed coverage of her five marriages, children, various lawsuits, radio roles and shoplifting headlines, Shearer has combined extensive archival research with insightful interview quotes. The result is a fascinating biography that recreates Hollywood's Golden Age of Glamour. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A tiny and politically inconsequential country, Nicaragua occupied a front-burner place in negotiations between the United States and Soviet Union, even when neither party seemed to care much about the ultimate fate of that nation. In the end, the Reagan doctrine of containment ended in failure, as an avowedly Marxist government held power for more than a decade. But so, too, did the Soviet doctrine of expansionism yield no fruit. Kagan credits Costa Rican president Oscar Arias with finding a way to break the impasse in U.S.-Soviet-Nicaraguan relations, thanks to which the Bush administration restored full diplomatic exchange and negotiated the free elections that brought democratic forces to power in Managua.Kagan contends that the Carter administration's halfhearted intervention in Nicaragua was in response to American feelings of guilt for Washington's longtime support of the Somoza dynasty. The Reagan-era intervention, on the other hand, originated in American anxiety over Soviet encroachment in the Western hemisphere. Kagan recounts how American popular aversion to the employment of U.S. military muscle in Central America led to the administration's covert support of the contras and goes on to explain how the clash between the Reagan White House and Congress over "freedom fighter" funding led to the Iran-contra affair in 1987. Although the surprising electoral victory of Violeta Chamorro over the Sandinistas was widely recognized as a success for American policy, the U.S. remains caught in a continuous cycle of intervention and withdrawal in Nicaragua, according to Kagan. As a member of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, Kagan was a direct participant in many of the events described in this authoritative and definitive account of U.S.<br><i>Nicaragua relations from 1977 to 1990. </i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Annie&#39;s Box: Charles Darwin, His Daughter And Human Evolution by Randal Keynes (2001-05-03)</h2><p>With illustrations and index.</p><p></p><h2>Jung&#39;s Struggle with Freud: A Metabiological Study</h2><p>As Hogenson writes in chapter 1: &#34;Jung&#39;s memory of the ocean passage (from Jung&#39;s memoirs recording a voyage to America with Freud) focuses our attention on the central problem of this essay: What does it mean to lay claim to personal authority in a world where biography and autobiography have become thematic for an entire cultural discourse?

Utopian thinking does not undermine or discount real reforms. Indeed, it is almost the opposite: practical reforms depend on utopian dreaming."--Russell Jacoby, <i>Picture Imperfect</i><br><br>Utopianism suffers from an image problem: A recent exhibition on utopias in Paris and New York included photographs of Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf</i> and a Nazi concentration camp. Many observers judge utopians and their sympathizers as foolhardy dreamers at best and murderous totalitarians at worst. However, as noted social critic and historian Russell Jacoby argues in this salient, polemical, and innovative work, not only has utopianism been unfairly characterized, a return to an iconoclastic utopian spirit is vital for today's society. Shaped by the works of Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Bloch, Gustav Landauer, and other predominantly Jewish thinkers, iconoclastic utopianism revives society's dormant political imagination and offers hope for a better future. Writing against the grain of history, Jacoby reexamines the anti-utopian mindset and identifies how utopian thought came to be regarded with such suspicion. He challenges standard readings of such anti-utopian classics as <i>1984</i> and <i>Brave New World</i> and offers stinging critiques of the influential liberal and anti-utopian theorists Hannah Arendt, Isaiah Berlin, and Karl Popper. He argues that these thinkers mistakenly equate utopianism with totalitarianism.<br><br>The reputation of utopian thought has also suffered from the failures of, what Jacoby terms, the blueprint utopian tradition and its oppressive emphasis on detailing all aspects of society and providing fantastic images of the future. In contrast, the iconoclastic utopians, like those who follow God's prohibition against graven images, resist both the blueprinters' obsession with detail and the modern seduction of images. Jacoby suggests that by learning from the hopeful spirit of iconoclastic utopians and their willingness to accept new possibilities for society, we open ourselves to new and more imaginative ideas of the future.</p><p>Many observers judge utopians and their sympathizers as foolhardy dreamers at best and murderous totalitarians at worst.

The impression Shklovsky (1916-85) left with most Americans he encountered on his infrequent visits from the Soviet Union was one not only of scientific brilliance but of a sharp wit, shocking outspokenness, and unusual likability. These qualities shine forth in these memoirs of a self-described fortunate fellow--born into a poor Ukrainian Jewish household--who rose, after many rejections, to a seat in the Soviet Academy and a major role in that nation's space program. Shrewd and amusing observations of Soviet scientific life include a portrait of the young Sakharov as a painfully introverted mama's boy (the two scientists remained friends for life); the habit one Soviet mathematician maintained, for the continued success of his career, of expressing encoded thanks for Stalin's death into all his work; the contagious joy Shklovsky experienced on the few occasions he was allowed abroad: to Brazil, where he attempted to record a solar eclipse; to Paris, where he nearly starved on a Soviet allowance; to New York, where he watched, entranced, the televised transmission of the Apollo 8 mission; to San Francisco, where he was entertained by Edward Teller; and to Albuquerque, where, over Mexican food, he discussed the possibility of extraterrestrial life with astrophysicist Phil Morrison, one of the instigators of SETI. Bitter reminders of Soviet anti-Semitism and the arrests Shklovsky witnessed in his long career add bite to his generally sunny and shrewd anecdotes. His death in 1984, before the current Soviet thaw, makes this collection particularly poignant. A joyful, inspiring and often provocative gesture of fellowship from the other side of the wall. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

When an elderly man is stabbed to death in an elevator and a crewman on an Italian fishing trawler is machine-gunned by a Tunisian patrol boat off Sicily's coast, only Inspector Montalbano, with his keen insight into human nature, suspects the link between the two incidents. <p> Available only in Wheeler Softcover 4.</p></p><p>ANDREA CAMILLERI is the internationally bestselling author of the 'Inspector Montalbano' mystery series and several historical novels set in nineteenth-century Sicily. His books have been translated into eight languages. He lives in Rome. <br><br> STEPHEN SARTARELLI is an award-winning translator and poet. He lives in France.In his third Inspector Salvo Montalbano mystery to be made available in the U.S., Camilleri (The Shape of Water) displays all the storytelling skills that have made him an international bestseller. When gunfire from a Tunisian patrol boat kills a worker on an Italian fishing trawler, the worldly Sicilian police inspector knows that this is just the type of situation his overly ambitious second-in-command, Mimi Augello, will want to exploit. Meanwhile, Montalbano has to look into the stabbing death of a retiree in the elevator of the victim's apartment building. While the trawler incident appears to resolve itself, the elevator slaying gets more complex by the minute. Soon Montalbano is searching for the retiree's beautiful housekeeper (and sometimes prostitute) and her son. It's only when he finds the boy (the snack thief of the title) that Montalbano learns the true nature of the case, its relation to the trawler shooting and the danger it poses. Although warned to keep his distance, Montalbano, who can't deny his investigative instincts any more than he can refuse a hardy portion of sardines a beccafico, proceeds headlong into the thick of government corruption with a risky plan to set things right. Montalbano, despite his curmudgeonly exterior, has a depth to him that charms. Readers are sure to savor this engrossing, Mafia-free Sicilian mystery. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Golf Omnibus</h2><p>Spine creased, page edges tanned.

Under the gracious sway of his gospel, Christ will cause &#34;the righteous to flourish&#34; (72:7) and bring &#34;peace to the people&#34; (Psa. 72:5). Resulting from this righteousness and peace will come &#34;abundance&#34; and &#34;flourishing&#34; prosperity in all the earth (72:16). Ultimately, &#34;all nations [will] call him blessed&#34; (72:17) so that &#34;the whole earth [will] be filled with his glory&#34; (72:19). Such is the postmillennial hope. Christ will return after millennial conditions prevail upon the earth (hence, post-millennialism), not before them (as in the popular pre-millennial system). The millennial blessings arise under the influence of the gospel, not because of Armageddon. Though many evangelicals today are concerned about being Left Behind before the future collapses into absolute chaos, the postmillennialist is optimistic that He Shall Have Dominion throughout the earth. Rather than adopting &#34;I&#39;ll Fly Away&#34; as their anthem, postmillennialists prefer &#34;Onward Christian Soldiers.&#34; In this book you will find the whole biblical rationale for postmillennialism, from its incipient beginning in Genesis to its glorious conclusion in Revelation.</p><p>Kenneth L.

Soviet artist Spirin has select ed classic folktales from five different countries as the vehicle for his enchant ing illustrations. In George MacDon ald's Little Daylight , a princess' beauty waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon. Alexander Pushkin's version of Snow White replaces the seven dwarfs with seven handsome brothers. Both will be welcomed by storytellers, folk lorists, and those who enjoy reading aloud. Also included are The Nutcrack er , Miguel de Cervantes' The Beautiful Kitchen Maid , and Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes . Painting in a style reminiscent of Renaissance oils, Spirin provides handsome characters and amazing details that will delight readers of all ages. The portraits of the Mouse Queen's 22 relatives, attired in court dress as they devour the pork in tended for the Queen's sausages, will keep children fascinated for hours. Adding to the enchantment is the de sign of the book, which varies full-page illustration with borders, one-third cuts, and single characters against a white background. Intricate borders tie some illustrations or illustration and text together. While there are no notes on sources, the combination of folktale selection and outstanding illustration make this a good choice to round out folktale collections. Constance A.

Spirin carves the space for his work out of the page, using for borders tall spindly trees, a winding path of wildflowers and the curling length of entwined snakes. There is not just one enchanted land for the tales, but five, for he creates a world faithful to the origin of each story.

Original.</p><p>PJ Parrish has worked as a newspaper reporter and editor, arts reviewer, blackjack dealer and personnel director in a Mississippi casino. The author currently lives in Southaven Mississippi and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Landing a job with the police force in Loon Lake, Mich., a resort town "winter wonderland," sounds idyllic to Louis Kincaid, but when he meets his chief, ex-military man Brian Gibralter, he realizes that he has much to learn about small-town proceedings. Gibralter is all spit and polish, a taskmaster who preaches absolute loyalty to the force. Although Louis's fellow officers are friendly, he begins to question Gibralter's motives for hiring him when he learns that his predecessor, also a young African-American, was murdered, a mysteriously scrawled playing card found beside him. One murder is disturbing enough in the peaceful area, so when a former cop is found frozen with a bullet in him, fear that a psychopath is stalking the department spreads. The brutality of the acts suggests revenge, but Louis quickly realizes that the killer must have studied his victims closely. As Louis investigates further, he becomes cautious even with partner Jesse Harrison and the enigmatic Zoe Devereaux. Parrish (Dark of the Moon) deftly depicts the empty winter landscape and the relentless intensity of the killer's pursuit. A suspenseful tale of a man who must question his principles and loyalties, Parrish's latest will appeal to those seeking a fast-paced thriller propelled by a cast of charismatic characters. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Type 7 U-Boats</h2><p>This study of the Type VII as a weapon of war and a carrier of firepower offers a technical history as well as fascinating narrative accounts by the men who operated the boats.</p><p></p><h2>The Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict</h2><p><b>The earliest known prison memoir by an African American writer&#x2014;recently discovered and authenticated by a team of Yale scholars&#x2014;sheds light on the longstanding connection between race and incarceration in America.<br></b><br><b>&#x201c;[A] harrowing [portrait] of life behind bars . . . part confession, part jeremiad, part lamentation, part picaresque novel (reminiscent, at times, of Dickens and Defoe).&#x201d;&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE</i></b><br><br> In 2009, scholars at Yale University came across a startling manuscript: the memoir of Austin Reed, a free black man born in the 1820s who spent most of his early life ricocheting between forced labor in prison and forced labor as an indentured servant. Lost for more than one hundred and fifty years, the handwritten document is the first known prison memoir written by an African American. Corroborated by prison records and other documentary sources, Reed&#x2019;s text gives a gripping first-person account of an antebellum Northern life lived outside slavery that nonetheless bore, in its day-to-day details, unsettling resemblances to that very institution.<br><br> Now, for the first time, we can hear Austin Reed&#x2019;s story as he meant to tell it. He was born to a middle-class black family in the boomtown of Rochester, New York, but when his father died, his mother struggled to make ends meet. Still a child, Reed was placed as an indentured servant to a nearby family of white farmers near Rochester. He was caught attempting to set fire to a building and sentenced to ten years at Manhattan&#x2019;s brutal House of Refuge, an early juvenile reformatory that would soon become known for beatings and forced labor.<br><br> Seven years later, Reed found himself at New York&#x2019;s infamous Auburn State Prison. It was there that he finished writing this memoir, which explores America&#x2019;s first reformatory and first industrial prison from an inmate&#x2019;s point of view, recalling the great cruelties and kindnesses he experienced in those places and excavating patterns of racial segregation, exploitation, and bondage that extended beyond the boundaries of the slaveholding South, into free New York.<br><br> Accompanied by fascinating historical documents (including a series of poignant letters written by Reed near the end of his life), <i>The Life and the Adventures of a Haunted Convict</i> is a work of uncommon beauty that tells a story of nineteenth-century racism, violence, labor, and captivity in a proud, defiant voice.

I was then at the age of six. After taking the last look of the dying man, I turned from the dying scene, leaving the angel of death to finish the last and awful work: but oh, who could describe the feelings of my boyish heart, when I saw my father laid cold and lifeless in the coffin? Then, that was the hour when all the fond recollection of my dying father came rushing in my mind. His last look, his last dying advice, i.e., his last prayer and his last blessing, that I might be kept from all the snares and temptations of the world, and that I might grow up and become a useful man, that I might be a help meet to my mother when she should be bowing down beneath the weight of old age.<br><br>How often in my boyish days, when the bright sun was just about to sink beneath the mountain tops, and the night hawks a hovering over my head, have I stolen away from the cottage and from the side of my mother, and gone and sat for hours at the grave of my beloved father, all unnoticed to him, and there wept like an infant. How fresh does the dying scene yet impress upon my memory, although my father has now been dead for nearly twenty years, and in yonder&#x2019;s old grave yard in the city of Rochester lies the cold remains of my father, moldering away to dust.1 While the feet of the traveler has trampled o&#x2019;er his grave, unmind of who the slumber is that lies beneath his feet, the cold winter winds are howling and playing o&#x2019;er his grave, yet there he lays, unmindful of those northern blasts that comes whistling o&#x2019;er his tomb.<br><br>Chapter II<br><br>No sooner had the cold clods covered the remains of my father before I forgot his last blessing and dying prayer with all of his advice. I soon broke through the restraints of my mother and fell a victim to vice and crime.<br><br>&#x2019;Twas a beautiful summer&#x2019;s morning that my mother put fifty cents into my hand and bade me to go to the grocery and get her four pounds of sugar. I took the fifty cents and went off to the bank and got it change all into coppers. I then steered my way behind an old barn where a lot of boys was pitching pennies. I fell into the game with them and soon found that they both was pitching against me. I left their company, and being the winner of three cents I then went to the grocery and bought the sugar and returned home.<br><br>As I entered the door my mother ask me if I had been making that sugar. She order me to be seated in one corner of the room and not to leave the House again during the day. While she went out to the well to draw a pail of water, I slip out of the back door and made my way to the city, a loitering round the street until night overtook me. I then steered my way for Home.<br><br>The dim light of a candle was burning in the House. I crept softly under the window, and there I laid a listening and shivering with fear of an awful punishment the moment I entered the room. As I laid there under the window, I could hear my mother talking to my brothers and sisters2 in the following manner&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;That boy will surely be the cause of bringing my gray hairs with sorrow down to the grave.&#x201d;<br><br>As she said them words, I rose and went to the door, and giving a genteel rap, my mother bade me enter. I opened the door and went in and saw the scoalding tears come a rushing down my mother cheeks. She order me off to bed, where I turned in and slept away the gloomy hours of the night. It was a long time after breakfast before I arose and went down stairs.<br><br>There sat my mother with her needle and thread, all alone, while my brothers and sister were gone off to school. My mother now took me into the bedroom, and with all the affection and the tears of a mother she talk to me in the following manner&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;My son, I see since your father has been dead that you are beginning to cause me a great deal of trouble. Remember that if you follow the paths of sin that you will surely come to some bad and awful end.&#x201d; With these and many other words of instruction did my mother try to bring up before my mind and to implant the truths of religion in my heart. She then gave me a severe whipping and sent me off to school.<br><br>On my way to school I met several boys who ask me to join their company that day, that they was goin&#x2019; to have some fun. I stuff my book into my pocket and joined their company&#x2014;�but alas that day&#x2019;s fun proved the dearest fun to me than ever I witness before in my life, for we were no sooner together before we jump over into a man&#x2019;s orchard and cut down several of his fruit trees and made our way for the city. It was three days afterwards before my mother found it out. The farmer came up to my mother&#x2019;s House and informed her all about the deed. My mother bursted out in a full flood of tears and predicted that if I went on in this way, regardless of my father&#x2019;s dying advice, that I would one day or another become the felon of a cell, and that it would be better for me if I was laying in my grave aside of my father. As she uttered those sacred words and the name of my father, the prayers, the blessing, and the advice of my dying father all sprung up afresh into my mind.<br><br>My mother told the farmer that I should be punished right on the spot for the deed, that she wouldn&#x2019;t allow her children to destroy other folks&#x2019; property if she knew it. As she said these words, she took a rawhide from the mantelpiece and ordered me to strip off my coat. I jump for the ax that stood behind the door and, raising it at my mother&#x2019;s head, told her if she struck me one blow with that rawhide that I would sliver her brains out on the floor. The old farmer arose to take the ax from my hand, to which I threw it at him with all my might, which left a deep cut in his leg. I then ran out the door and went into the city and was gone from Home three days.<br><br>Chapter III<br><br>&#x2019;Twas a wet drizzly day in the month of July as I was strolling the street, and had been gone from Home three days, that the heavy hand of a constable was laid upon me to restore me back to my mother. As I went along through the streets, I was stared at by every one that went along. Shivering with the wet and cold and pinched with hunger, I soon gain the threshold of my mother&#x2019;s cottage door, covered with rags and dirt. There sat a rich old farmer in the House who lived out to Avon Springs, ready to take me away. Oh how I wept, how I cried, how I beg my mother not to let me be separated away from her. With what fair and faithful promises did I make to my mother for the time to come, if she would only let me stay with her at Home. My promises, my tears availed me nothing. My mother had firmly made up her mind that I should be sent from a city life and live a country life.<br><br>After striking a bargain with the old country hound, the day was appointed to which I was to start for the country. My mother wash me and gave me something to eat and then took a bed cord and made my hands and feet fast to keep me in custody until Mr. Lad (for that was the farmer&#x2019;s name) came after me.3 At night my mother unloosed me and sent me off up stairs to bed, taking good care to lock the door to keep me safe. The next morning before my mother was up my youngest sister came up stairs and told me that the farmer would be after me that day at ten o&#x2019;clock, and that mother had got my Sunday clothes ready for me to put on. She advise me not to stir a step with him, for if I did I should never see my Home nor her again.<br><br>The tears came from my sister eyes as she said those words to me. The call of my mother soon brought her from my bed side, telling her to make haste and get the House cleaned up, for she expected Mr. Lad along very soon. My mother then called me up and wash me from head to foot, put a new suite of clothes on me which I use to wear Sundays. While my mother was getting me ready, I casted my eyes out of the window and saw a splendid carriage driving up to the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Wonder who is there!&#x201d; exclaimed my sister in an angry tone.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, it Mr. Lad and his daughter,&#x201d; said my mother with a smile.<br><br>The horses was made fast at the fence and the carriage flung open, while my mother stood ready to take the hand of a beautiful country female to help her from the carriage. There me and my sister stood in the door, both bathe in tears. The country girl made a low bow to my sister, to which she got an ugly sour look for her compliment.<br><br>My mother then took me into the bedroom, and kneeling down she implored the blessing of the almighty to go with me and be with me, to protect me and to be the guide of my youth. She then arose, a putting a pocket bible into my hand, beg me to read it and to take it as the man of my counsel, and that if I obeyed it precepts, it would do me good in after life.<br><br>There me and my sister stood, hand in hand, bathe in tears of grief and sorrow. My mother then imprinted a kiss on my cheek and told Mr. Lad that I was now all ready to start.<br><br>As the old man and his daughter arose, my sister told me not to stir from the House one step, that she would protect me. By this time my elder brother came in and, seeing me and my sister bathe in tears, could not bear to witness the scene of separation and the grief and sorrow between me and my sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you goin&#x2019; to take my brother away?&#x201d; exclaimed my sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the countryman.<br><br>&#x201c;By whose authority?&#x201d; said my brother.<br><br>&#x201c;We will give you to understand,&#x201d; said my sister, &#x201c;that he is not a goin&#x2019; with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows,&#x201d; said my brother, &#x201c;but what he is goin&#x2019; into the hands of some slave holder?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all!&#x201d; exclaimed the country girl. &#x201c;His work will be easy and light, and at the end of every three months he may return Home.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother all this time during the conversation stood on the floor with one hand up to her face, not knowing what to say.<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose, mother,&#x201d; said my sister, &#x201c;that you think it hard to see your children arising up and interfering in your business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; said my mother. &#x201c;The city will surely spoil that boy if he stays Home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unless that man can prove before me by good and substantial witnesses that he is no slave holder,&#x201d; said my brother, &#x201c;he can&#x2019;t go one step with him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think it proper,&#x201d; said my sister, &#x201c;that we should know where he is goin&#x2019; and into whose hands he is goin&#x2019; into, and I think my mother has taken a very improper course in this matter, and I think it my duty as a sister to interfere into this matter, before our brother is torn from his Home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Mr. Lad, &#x201c;I live out to Avon Springs, and it is getting quite late in the day, and I have twenty miles to go. I would like to have the boy, for he looks like a smart boy.&#x201d; The old man whispered something into my mother ear and drove off without me.<br><br>Early the next morning, the tramp of horses and the rattling of a carriage was heard at the door. Peeping out of the window, I saw Mr. Lad and his daughter standing at the gate. He had a new pair of shoes into his hand, while his daughter held a new cap in her left hand. He had bought those things for me for inducement, to get me to go Home with him.<br><br>As he entered the door, he said that he was in a hurry and ask me if I had made up my mind to go Home with him. I told him that I would let him know in a few minutes. I then left him and called my sister out of doors and talk the matter over with her, to which she consented I should go, providing that I should be sent Home every three months. The bargain being struck, the old farmer drove off with his prize, and I soon found myself seated under the roof of a lordly mansion at Avon Springs.<br><br>Chapter IV<br><br>&#x2019;Twas in the year of 1833 that my troubles commenced. I now found myself under the roof of a new Home at Avon Springs. With a sad and a heavy heart I went out under the wood shed, and seating myself on a pile of wood, I began to repent that ever I had left the Home of my nativity, while ten thousand thoughts came pouring into my breast, with fond recollections of those brothers and sisters at Home, of the advice of my dying father, the tears which my sister shed before I left my Home, the prayer which my mother had offered up the day before I left. After pondering over those things with deep feelings, I drew the little pocket bible which my mother had given me before I left Home from my pocket, and there I saw the handwriting of my mother, and the little prayer which she had wrote there for me to learn. After reading a few of its contents I closed the little book, and have never open it from that day to this, but still my mother&#x2019;s handwriting still stands against me&#x2014;�the prayer, the tears, the griefs and her sorrows.</p><h2>Father Brown--A Selection (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This edition presents 28 of the best Father Brown stories, chosen and introduced by their finest critic, W.

Now, in his first book, Chris offers readers extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Chris Hadfield decided to become an astronaut after watching the Apollo moon landing with his family on Stag Island, Ontario, when he was nine years old, and it was impossible for Canadians to be astronauts. In 2013, he served as Commander of the International Space Station orbiting the Earth during a five-month mission. Fulfilling this lifelong dream required intense focus, natural ability and a singular commitment to &#x201c;thinking like an astronaut.&#x201d; In <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide to Life on Earth</i>, Chris gives us a rare insider&#x2019;s perspective on just what that kind of thinking involves, and how earthbound humans can use it to achieve success and happiness in their lives.<br>Astronaut training turns popular wisdom about how to be successful on its head. Instead of visualizing victory, astronauts prepare for the worst; always sweat the small stuff; and do care what others think. Chris shows how this unique education comes into play with dramatic anecdotes about going blind during a spacewalk, getting rid of a live snake while piloting a plane, and docking with space station Mir when laser tracking systems fail at the critical moment. Along the way, he shares exhilarating experiences, and challenges, from his 144 days on the ISS, and provides an unforgettable answer to his most-asked question: What&#x2019;s it <i>really </i>like in outer space?<br>Written with humour, humility and a profound optimism for the future of space exploration, <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide to Life on Earth </i>offers readers not just the inspiring story of one man&#x2019;s journey to the ISS, but the opportunity to step into his space-boots and think like an astronaut&#x2014;and renew their commitment to pursuing their own dreams, big or small.</p></p><p>Chris Hadfield is one of the most seasoned and accomplished astronauts in the world. The top graduate of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in 1988 and U.S. Navy test pilot of the year in 1991, Hadfield was selected by the Canadian Space Agency to be an astronaut in 1992. He was CAPCOM for 25 Shuttle launches and served as Director of NASA Operations in Star City, Russia, from 2001&#x2013;2003, Chief of Robotics at the Johnson Space Center in Houston from 2003&#x2013;2006, and Chief of International Space Station Operations from 2006&#x2013;2008. Hadfield most recently served as Commander of the International Space Station where, while conducting a record-setting number of scientific experiments and overseeing an emergency spacewalk, he gained worldwide acclaim for his breathtaking photographs and educational videos about life in space. His music video, a zero-gravity version of David Bowie&#x2019;s &#x201c;Space Oddity,&#x201d; received over 10 million views in its first three days online.<p><b>WINNER 2013 &#x2013; CBA Libris Non-Fiction Book of the Year Award&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER</b><br><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>A <i>Globe and Mail </i>Best Book</b><br><b>A <i>Book Riot </i>Best Book</b><br><b>A <i>Slate </i>Best Book</b><br><br>&#x201c;Chris Hadfield is easily the world&#x2019;s most famous living moustache-tronaut, having done more to promote the concept of off-Earth travel and exploration than anyone since William Shatner first stepped onto the bridge of the <i>Enterprise</i>....

His passion, commitment and extraordinary achievements make him a larger-than-life hero.&#x201d; &#x2014;Heather Reisman, Indigo&#x2019;s Chief Booklover and CEO<br><br>&#x201c;Remember that Canadian dude with the moustache who sang an amazing accomplished zerogravity version of <i>Space Oddity </i>on the International Space Station this year? It turns out he can write, too. <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide to Life on Earth </i>is the book Chris Hadfield was destined to produce from the moment they pulled him out of his Soyuz space capsule on the Kazakh steppe and told him he had seven million YouTube hits. It is unapologetically gung-ho, and it instantly takes its place on the admittedly lonely shelf of books that make the case for human space exploration in the post-Apollo, post-Shuttle age. . . . The book was written at speed but feels thoughtful rather than hasty. . . . It&#x2019;s a fine line . . . between the small stuff and the life and death stuff that gives Hadfield&#x2019;s tale its juice. Not many people can describe from experience the difference between a Shuttle launch . . . and a launch in a Russian Proton rocket. . . . &nbsp;Not many people know what it is to glance behind you on a spacewalk and almost accidentally &#x2018;notice the Universe.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;Giles Whittell, <i>The Sunday Times </i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I found his fascinating <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide to Life on Earth</i> even more enjoyable than I expected. Mr. Hadfield teaches us not only about space but about people, too. Equally autobiographical and instructional, the book goes gleefully against the grain of most &#x2018;success&#x2019; books.... <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide to Life on Earth</i> isn&#x2019;t a compendium of hagiographic profiles; it&#x2019;s a very human glimpse into a rarefied world. Bound together by a love of exploration and discovery, tested by tragic catastrophes and everyday hardship, the men and women Mr. Hadfield introduces us to are real people: They fail, they succeed, they worry, they miss their families, they go to space and do things never done before. The vacuum of space is unforgiving and brutal. Life on earth isn&#x2019;t easy, either. Mr. Hadfield has genuinely and refreshingly increased our understanding of how to thrive in both places.&#x201d; &#x2014;Adam Savage, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hadfield is a good writer with an engaging style; I was always eager to get to the next chapter, and frequently found myself smiling at the stories he was spinning.... You might not think that someone who became an astronaut might have stories that will relate to your own Earthbound life, but in fact Hadfield has shown over and again that he&#x2019;s a master at making it all relatable. From his photos of Earth from space to his videos showing the daily grind of life on a 100-meter wide orbiting tin can, he is all about real life.&#x201d; &#x2014;Phil Plait, <i>Slate </i>(Best Book)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A page-turning memoir of life as a decorated astronaut.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i><br>&#x201c;The book is a trove of good advice on everything from personal development to survival, but he also knows a hell of a lot about getting the job&#x2014;any job&#x2014;done.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>AskMen</i><br><br>&#x201c;Not a business book per se, Colonel Hadfield&#x2019;s memoir recounts how insatiable curiosity, single-minded dedication and a healthy competitive streak propelled him to, quite literally, out-of-this world accomplishments.

Now in Hadfield&#x2019;s book readers come even closer to the man whose life and career have been seemingly other-worldly. <i>An Astronaut&#x2019;s Guide</i> includes eye-opening, adrenaline-filled stories of shuttle launches and space walks but it is also filled with Hadfield&#x2019;s counterintuitive life lessons.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Euro Weekly News&nbsp;</i></p></p><h2>City Reading: Written Words and Public Spaces in Antebellum New York (Popular Cultures, Everyday Lives)</h2><p>Cultural historian David Henkin explores the influential but little-noticed role played by reading in New York City's public life between 1825 and 1865. From the opening of the Erie Canal to the end of the Civil War, New York became a metropolis, and demographic, economic, and physical changes erased the old markers of continuity and order. As New York became a crowded city of strangers, everyday encounters with impersonal signs, papers, and bank notes altered people's perceptions of connectedness to the new world they lived in. The 'ubiquitous urban texts'--from newspapers to paper money, from street signs to handbills--became both indispensable urban guides and apt symbols for a new kind of public life that emerged first in New York. <i>City Reading</i> focuses on four principal categories of public reading: street signs and store signs; handbills and trade cards; newspapers; and paper money. Drawing on a wealth of visual sources and written texts that document the changing cityscape--including novels, diaries, newspapers, municipal guides, and government records--Henkin shows that public acts of reading (to a much greater extent than private, solitary reading) determined how New Yorkers of all backgrounds came to define themselves and their urban community.</p><p>Henkin explores the influential but little-noticed role reading played in New York City&#39;s public life between 1825 and 1865.

But it was truly a railway ahead of its time. It was a pioneer in combining land- and water-based transportation, including the introduction of river car-ferries and passenger/freight steamships on the Great Lakes. It made waves of a different kind with its acquisition of the American-owned railway linking Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee. And its mammoth workshops were industrial monuments in Hamilton and London, Ontario, where inventive geniuses laboured to supply the booming rail trade of southern Ontario.<br> <br> It was the ancestor of some of the most heavily used rail lines in all of Canada. This book has been written to do justice to a railway that truly must be considered one of Canada&#x2019;s trailblazing lines. Amply illustrated with previously unpublished photographs and a thorough historical record of the Great Western Railway&#x2019;s locomotives and rolling stock, it offers a ride back in time into the vanishing history of early Ontario railroading.</p><p>David R.P.

You will meet survivors whose stories explain such a paradox. Gripping stories of five flash floods that raged in the Grand Canyon and elsewhere in Arizona within a two-month span and killed 22 people.</p><p>When author Craig Childs tackles a project, we have learned to expect great things. His first book for Arizona Highways, GRAND CANYON: TIME BELOW THE RIM, won the Publishers Marketing Association's Benjamin Franklin Award for Best Nature Book of 1999. In 2002 he again brought home the Ben Franklin Award with THE SOUTHWEST'S CONTRARY LAND. <p>Now, in THE DESERT CRIES, Childs takes readers on a dramatic read into the roiling bellies of five flash floods that swept across the desert and through canyons in August and September of 1997, killing 19 people in Arizona alone. </p><p>The author summarizes the book this way: </p><p>"Illegal migrants from Mexico were swept through a storm drain while crossing the border. Eleven hikers perished as a wall of water plunged through a majestic slot canyon, leaving only their guide alive. More vanished in a flood down Phantom Canyon in the Grand Canyon. Surrounding these deadly floods came still more where, miraculously, no one was killed. At 90 miles per hour a passenger train plunged into a flooding arroyo near Kingman, Arizona. Two hundred people fled to safety as the Grand Canyon's Havasu Canyon flooded, exploding rafts and kayaks out of its mouth into the Colorado River. </p><p>"This book chronicles the events of that summer, some of them only two days apart. While working on a master's thesis focusing primarily on the dynamics of desert floods, I turned my attention to these accumulating disasters. I found that in a land commonly believed to be free of floods, people were dying each summer like clockwork. I spoke to survivors and to rescuers who exhumed bodies from the deep mud of canyon floors. I studies radar imagery of the storms in question and retraced each event in painful detail. </p><p>"Like the floods themselves, this is a swift, sudden book. It throws the stories out as quickly as they happened. Each story is intense and brief, giving insight into the hydrology of a slot canyon flood, or the natural movement of thunderstorms, but focusing on the details of what happened as those very moments. This book is not written to sensationalize. It is merely an offering of stories."</p>If you have never seen a flash flood, you'll experience five of them in this book, and you will meet survivors. Here's an excerpt from the account of a flood that smashed through a storm drain in the border town of Douglas: <p>"The sound becomes unbearable. It growls and screams as it bears down on the migrants. The woman hands her two-year-old to the man as she hurries up the ladder. Just as she grabs for the girl, the water smashes into the man like he's the bowsprit of a ship. He keels over and rolls head-first with the girl in his hands. He doesn't know up from down and can't find the air. His body uncoils in a panic, his arms flailing. The girl slips away. </p><p>"Two men behind him field the toddler. They pass and shove the small body ahead, toward the ladder. </p><p>"Again the water takes the child, sweeping her past a couple of people before someone catches her by her wrist. The men push her ahead. Finally, a man grabs her and passes her up to her mother on the ladder. </p><p>"Without his arms braced against the tunnel, the man loses his balance. He tries to grab the next ladder, but his fingers just snap past the shaft, too fast. By the third block, he is traveling so fast that he has no sense of direction. He feels bones break in his hand when it reaches for a ladder. Turned upside-down and unable to breathe, he feels the fear. Now he knows that he will die."</p></p><h2>Last Voyage of the Valentina</h2><p>Set in London during the swinging sixties and Italy&#x2019;s Amalfi coast after Word War II, <i>The Last Voyage</i> of the Valentina is an epic romance with a dark uncercurrent of suspense from an author the <i>Daily Mail</i> (UK) has declared &#x201c;is the new Rosamunde Pilcher.&#x201d;<br><br>Exotically beautiful but desperately unhappy, Alba lives on a houseboat on the Thames, where she enjoys a life of leisure and entertains an endless and unfulfilling succession of lovers. But then she discovers a portrait of her dead mother, Valentina&#x2014;a woman she'd hardly known, whose story has been kept from her by her still grieving father. Determined to learn the truth about Valentina, Alba returns to the olive groves of the Amalfi coast of Italy. There she uncovers a mysterious tale of decadence, deception, murder, and betrayal involving partisans and Nazis, peasants, and counts. Alba's journey leads her not only to the truth of her mother&#x2019;s hidden past but to the possibility of happiness in her own future.</p><p>Santa Montefiore&#x2019;s&nbsp;books have been translated into more than twenty-five languages and have sold more than six million copies in England and Europe.

Although it was a balmy spring evening, she pulled her tasseled shawl about her shoulders and took a long drag of her cigarette.</p><p>"Not spying again, darling!" said Fitz with a wry smile.</p><p>"One can't help noticing the comings and goings of that girl's lovers." Viv narrowed her hooded eyes and inhaled through dilated nostrils.</p><p>"Anyone would think you were jealous," Fitz commented, grimacing as he took a sip of cheap French wine. In all the years he had been Viv's friend and agent she had never once bought a bottle of good wine.</p><p>"I'm a writer. It's my business to be curious about people. Alba's engaging. She's a very selfish creature, but one can't help being drawn to her. The ubiquitous moth to the flame. Though, in my case, not a moth at all but a rather beautifully dressed butterfly." She wandered across the deck and draped herself over a chair, spreading her blue and pink caftan about her like silken wings. "Still, I enjoy her life. It'll do for a book one day, when we're no longer friends. I think Alba's like that. She enjoys people, then moves on. In our case, it shall be I who moves on. By then, the dramas of her life will no longer entertain me and, besides, I'll have grown bored of the Thames too. My old bones will ache from the damp, and the creaking and bumping will keep me up at night. Then I shall buy a small ch�teau in France and retire to obscurity, fame having become a bore too." She sucked in her cheeks and grinned at Fitz. But Fitz was no longer listening, although it was his job to.</p><p>"Do you think they pay for it?" he said, putting his hands on the railing and looking down into the muddy water of the Thames. Beside him, Sprout, his old springer spaniel, lay sleeping on a blanket.</p><p>"Certainly not!" she retorted. "Her father owns the boat. She's not having to fork out twelve pounds a week in rent, I assure you."</p><p>"Then she's simply liberated."</p><p>"Just like everyone else of her generation. Following the herd. It bores me. I was before my time, Fitzroy. I took lovers and smoked cannabis long before the Albas of this world knew of the existence of either. Now I prefer bog standard Silva Thins and celibacy. I'm fifty, too old to be a slave to fashion. It's all so frivolous and childish. Better to set my mind on higher things. You may be a good ten years younger than me, Fitzroy, but I can tell the world of fashion bores you too."</p><p>"I don't think Alba would bore me."</p><p>"But you, my dear, would bore her, eventually. You might think you're a swaggering Lothario, Fitzroy, but you'd meet your match in Alba. She isn't like other girls. I'm not saying you'd have trouble bedding her, but keeping her, now that's a very different story. She likes variety. Her lovers don't last long. I've seen them come and go. It's always the same, they skip up the gangplank; then, when it's all over, they plod off like ill-treated mongrels. She'd have you for dinner then spit you out like a chicken bone, and that would be a shock, wouldn't it, darling? I bet no one's ever done that to you before. It's called karma. What goes around, comes around. Pay you back for breaking so many hearts. Anyway, at your age, you should be looking for your third wife, not a transitory thrill. You should be settling down. Set your heart on one woman and keep it there. She's fiery because she's half Italian."</p><p>"Ah, that explains the dark hair and honey skin."</p><p>Viv looked at him askance and her thin lips extended into an even thinner smile.</p><p>"But those very pale eyes, strange..." He sighed, no longer noticing the taste of cheap wine.</p><p>"Her mother was Italian. She died when Alba was born. In a car crash, I think. Has a horrid stepmother and a bore for a father. Navy, you know. Still there, the old fossil. Has had the same desk job since the war, I suspect. Commutes every day, very dreary. Captain Thomas Arbuckle, and he's definitely a Thomas and not a Tommy. Not like you, who are more of a Fitz than a Fitzroy, though I do love the name Fitzroy and shall continue to use it regardless. No wonder Alba rebelled."</p><p>"Her father might be a bore, but he's a rich bore." Fitz ran his eyes over the shiny wooden houseboat that gently rocked from the motion of the tide. Or from Alba's lovemaking. The thought made his stomach cramp competitively.</p><p>"Money doesn't bring happiness. You should know that, Fitzroy."</p><p>Fitz stared into his glass a moment, reflecting on his own fortune that had brought him only avaricious wives and expensive divorces.</p><p>"Does she live alone?"</p><p>"She used to live with one of her half sisters, but it didn't work out. I can't imagine the girl's easy to live with, God bless her. The trouble with you, Fitzroy, is that you fall in love much too easily. If you could keep control of your heart, life would be a lot simpler for you. You could just bed her and get her out of your system. Ah, about time too! You're late!" she exclaimed as her nephew Wilfrid hurried down the pontoon with his girlfriend Georgia in tow, full of apologies. Viv could be quite fearsome when they showed up late for bridge.</p><p></p><p>The <i>Valentina</i> was a houseboat unlike any other on Cheyne Walk. The curve of the prow was pretty, upturned, coy as if she were trying to contain a knowing smile. The house itself was painted blue and white with round windows and a balcony where pots spilled over with flowers in springtime and leaks let in the rain during the winter months. Like a face that betrays the life it has lived, so the eccentric dip in the line of the roof and the charming slope of the bow, like a rather imperious nose, revealed that perhaps she had lived many lives. The overriding characteristic of the Valentina, therefore, was her mystery. Like a grande dame who would never be seen without her makeup, the Valentina would not reveal what lay beneath her paint. Her mistress, however, loved her not for her unusual features, or her charm or indeed her uniqueness. Alba Arbuckle loved her boat for a very different reason.</p><p></p><p>"God, Alba, you're beautiful!" Rupert sighed, burying his face in her softly perfumed neck. "You taste of sugared almonds." Alba giggled, thinking him absurd, but unable to resist the sensation of his bristles that scratched and tickled and his hand that had already found its way past her blue suede clog boots and up her Mary Quant skirt. She wriggled with pleasure and lifted her chin.</p><p>"Don't talk, you fool. Kiss me."</p><p>This he did, determined to please her. He was heartened that she had suddenly come alive in his arms after a sulky supper in Chelsea. He pressed his lips to hers, relieved that as long as he entertained her tongue she couldn't use it to abuse him. Alba had a way of saying the most hurtful things through the sweetest, most beguiling, smile. And yet, those pale gray eyes of hers, like a moor on a misty winter morning, aroused a strange kind of pity that was disarming. Drew a man in. Made him yearn to protect her. To love her was easy, to keep her unlikely. But along with the other hopefuls who walked the well-trodden deck of the Valentina, he couldn't help but try.</p><p>Alba opened her eyes as he unbuttoned her blouse and took a nipple in his mouth. She looked up through the skylight to wispy pink clouds and the first twinkle of a star. Overwhelmed by the unexpected beauty of the dying day she momentarily let down her guard and her spirit was at once filled with sadness. It flooded her being and brought tears to those pale gray eyes, tears that stung. Her loneliness gnawed and ached, and nothing seemed to cure it. Appalled by the ill timing of such weakness she wound her legs around her lover and rolled over so that she sat on top, kissing and biting and clawing him like a wild cat. Rupert was stunned but more excited than ever. He eagerly ran his hands up her naked thighs to discover she wore no pants. Her buttocks lay smooth and exposed for him to caress with impatient fingers. Then he was inside her and she was riding him vigorously, as if aware only of the pleasure and not of the man who was providing it. Rupert gazed upon her in awe, longing to put his mouth to her lips that were slightly parted and bruised. She looked wanton and yet, in spite of her lack of inhibition, she possessed a vulnerability that made him yearn to hold her close.</p><p>Soon Rupert's thoughts were lost in the excitement of their lovemaking. He closed his eyes and surrendered to his desire, no longer lucid enough to contemplate her lovely face. They writhed and rolled over the piles of discarded clothes on the bed until they exploded onto the floor with a thud, out of breath and laughing. She looked at his surprised face with eyes that shone and said with a throaty chuckle, "What did you expect? The Virgin Mary?"</p><p>"That was wonderful.

He was a forthright Provencal already then with 17 years of naval and military experience. He was required to stay in Siam as admiral and general of the King of Siam's armies and governor of Bangkok, either because his military prowess and character impressed King Narai, or his bluntness gave rise to fears on the part of Phaulkon, the king's chief minister, that the real condition of the country's economy and the king's disinterest in conversion to Catholicism might be exposed to Louis XIV.<br>Forbin's memoirs, written long after his departure from Siam, were not published until 1729.

Eliot, Thornton Wilder, and Edmund Wilson</p><p>Paul Horgan is professor emeritus and author in residence at Wesleyan University.Southwestern novelist/historian Horgan (A Certain Climate, 1988, etc.), twice a Pulitzer-winner, offers 17 slight but sprightly essays on his encounters with artistic illuminati. These pieces--many of which first appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, The Yale Review, etc.--cover five decades, beginning with Horgan's comic meeting, as a teenaged reporter in New Mexico, with the poet Vachel Lindsay, who fended off inquiries about the youngster's poetry by rambling on about The Egyptian Book of the Dead. Two essays uncharacteristically involve not artists but cultural artifacts: the Sistine Chapel (where Horgan found himself all alone in August 1945) and the Vatican Library (where he was allowed to break the institution's ``100- year-rule'' limiting access to archives). Horgan seems most fascinated by the theatricality that celebrities project even when offstage (even the one nonprofessional celebrity here, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, emerges as a deft comic and mimic). But the problem with many of the portraits--for instance, of Garbo, Thornton Wilder, Somerset Maugham, Fyodor Chaliapin, and Broadway actress Minnie Maddern Fiske--is that they're based on such slender acquaintance that character development is nonexistent. The compensating factor is Horgan's succinct descriptive power (on T.S. Eliot: ``His eyes were gray, powerfully taking, under lids slanting aside....The general effect was that of composed good looks at the service of sober good manners''). The best pieces concern figures with whom Horgan became most intimate: Edmund Wilson, wooed by the author into a stint as a visiting scholar at Wesleyan, where the critic memorably displayed his ``oddments and crochets''; and Igor Stravinsky, during his last frail days. Glancing, at times superficial, brushes with the famous, told with affection and charm. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Parrot is the motherless son of an itinerant English engraver. Their lives are joined when Olivier sets sail for the New World to save his neck from one more revolution and Parrot is sent with him as spy, protector, foe, and foil. With the story of their unlikely friendship, Peter Carey explores the adventure of American democracy with the dazzling inventiveness and richness of characterization, story, and language that we have come to expect from this superlative writer.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2010</strong>: In this vivid and visceral work of historical fiction, two-time Booker Prize winner Peter Carey imagines the experiences of Alexis de Tocqueville, the great French political philosopher and author of <em>Democracy in America</em>. Carey brings de Tocqueville to life through the fictionalized character of Olivier de Garmont, a coddled and conceited French aristocrat. Olivier can only begin to grasp how the other half lives when forced to travel to the New World with John "Parrot" Larrit, a jaded survivor of lifelong hardship who can&#x2019;t stand his young master who he is expected to spy on for the overprotective Maman Garmont back in Paris. Parrot and Olivier are a mid-nineteenth-century Oscar and Felix who represent the highest and lowest social registers of the Old World, yet find themselves unexpectedly pushed together in the New World. This odd couple&#x2019;s stark differences in class and background, outlook and attitude&#x2014;which are explored in alternating chapters narrated by each&#x2014;are an ingenious conceit for presenting to contemporary readers the unique social experiment that was democracy in the early years of America. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em> <br><br> <br><br><strong>The Democracy of Story-Telling: A Review of <em>Parrot and Olivier in America</em> by Colum McCann</strong> <p><b>Colum McCann is the author of <em>Zoli</em>, <em>Dancer</em> and, most recently, <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>, which won the National Book Award for Fiction and was the Amazon editors' pick as the Best Book of 2009. Read his review of <em>Parrot and Olivier in America</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Faulkner famously wrote that the past is not dead, it's not even past. Every now and then a voice comes along to make the proper claim that nobody should forget and, even more radically, that nobody <i>should</i> be forgotten. These voices remind us that life is not yet written down: there is more to the story than meets the original word. Peter Carey has made an exquisite art of this sort of exploration into history and language: he smashes the atom of story-telling and comes up with quirks and quarks and quarries.</p> <p>Carey is a rogue in the very best sense of the word: we are led by delight into a story that is bound to be profound, complex, tender, demanding, reckless, rigorous, charming, and, indeed, true. The value of good literature is that there's always another story to unfold. And in the unfolding, we are led by mystery towards discovery. Strap on the Carey boots, you&#x2019;ll encounter new lands.</p> <p>Carey's newest novel, <i>Parrot and Olivier in America</i>, is the story of two men who begin their lives on different ends of the human spectrum. Olivier is an aristocrat, born in France just after the Revolution, while Parrot is the son of an itinerant English printer. Part of Carey's provocative genius is that, even in the title, Parrot is named before Olivier: it&#x2019;s the late 18th century and both men have swallowed the handcuffs of history. The servant and master. The dreamer and the dreamt. The men travel to America together, land in New York, embark on journeys that have both private and mythic overtones in the "you-knighted states." Ramshackle prisons. Convict ships. Broadway brawls. Land deals. Penal colonies. The small revolutions of human desire and failure.</p> <p>The men develop an understanding and a friendship and a complexity that is a hallmark of a Carey novel: it is a wonder, as he points out, how many lives can be held within one single skin. The story is an examination of how landscape forms character, and the instinct towards that most democratic of things, story-telling. The task of fiction is to achieve is, by the power of the written word, a glimpse of truth that we didn't necessarily know was available to us. Part of Carey's genius is his ability to allow the reader to become the instigator of ideas. <i>Parrot and Olivier in America</i> is a fantastic riff on the servant/master relationship that can relate to Tocqueville, or to Hegel, or to Nietzsche&#x2019;s "master morality," or indeed to the inanities of the Bush generation. Carey is well aware of the looking glass of history. Carey is here by being there. Whoever we are is whoever we have been. To label his work as "historical fiction" is to reduce the impact of what it means, and allows. He has his finger on the pulse. But not only that--he has shaped the vigorous graph of the beats.</p> <p>I recall my first foray into the Carey world. It was back in the early 80's and I picked up a book called <i>Bliss</i>. Harry Joy's heart attack on his front lawn was my own in literature: it resuscitated me. From there I stepped into the lives of <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> and then <i>Jack Maggs</i>. One of the greatest novels of the 20th century is <i>The True History of the Kelly Gang</i> which came in 2001 and is, without a doubt, an "adjectival" masterpiece. (I&#x2019;m going to carry that book with me &#x2013; along with DeLillo&#x2019;s <i>Underworld</i> and Ondaatje&#x2019;s <i>Coming through Slaughter</i>--to the gates of heaven or hell, whichever one will have me.) Recently Carey has written <i>My Life as a Fake</i>, <i>Theft</i> and <i>His Illegal Self</i>, all tours de force. What I love about his work is that it&#x2019;s smart and funny at the same time. It&#x2019;s always an adventure to read. I get transported out of myself, into a new world. The reader is allowed the dignity of exploration. It&#x2019;s a form of travel, a manner of being away and remaining at home. I happen now to have the pleasure of teaching with Peter Carey at Hunter College in New York&#x2013;-in fact, one of the reasons I&#x2019;m at Hunter is that I wanted to teach alongside him, to shape my writing and reading, and to learn from him. I do so every time I read a book of his. He&#x2019;s a master storyteller and a servant of language at the same time: he exists in that landscape with humility and grace. <i>Parrot and Olivier in America</i> is Peter Carey at his best: funny and tender and true.</p> (Photo � Matt Valentine) <br><br>Peter Carey is the author of ten previous novels and has twice received the Booker Prize. His other honors include the Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize and the Miles Franklin Literary Award.

It is 1899 and the last great Islamic empire is in serious trouble. A former tutor poses a question which the family has been refusing to confront for almost a century: &#x2018;Your Ottoman Empire is like a drunken prostitute, neither knowing nor caring who will take her next. Do I exaggerate, Memed?&#x2019; The history of Iskender Pasha&#x2019;s family mirrors the growing degeneration of the Empire they have served for the last five hundred years. This passionate story of masters and servants, school-teachers and painters, is marked by jealousies, vendettas and, with the decay of the Empire, a new generation which is deeply hostile to the half-truths and myths of the &#x2018;golden days.&#x2019;<br><br><i>The Stone Woman</i> is the third novel of Tariq Ali&#x2019;s &#x2018;Islam Quartet&#x2019;. Like its predecessors&#x2014;<i>Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree</i> and <i>The Book of Saladin&#x2014;</i>its power lies both in the story-telling and the challenge it poses to stereotyped images of life under Islam.</p><p><b>Tariq Ali</b> is a writer and filmmaker. He has written more than a dozen books on world history and politics&#x2014;including <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, <i>Bush in Babylon</i>, <i>The Clash of Fundamentalisms</i> and <i>The Obama Syndrome</i>&#x2014;as well as five novels in his Islam Quintet series and scripts for the stage and screen. He is an editor of the <i>New Left Review</i> and lives in London.The Ottoman Empire, known as the "sick man of Europe" in the 19th century, continues its slow, steady decline in the summer of 1899 as elderly Iskander Pasha (a descendant of a sultan's favorite courtier) and his well-born family gather at their seaside palace outside Istanbul. Ali, a well-known leftist activist in Britain, explores the complexities of the Ottoman mentality in his fifth outing, a colorful, sensual drama of families, sexual intrigue and rebellion. As the novel begins, Iskander suffers a stroke and loses his power of speech. Various members of the family tell their stories, interwoven with chapters transcribing confessions made to the "stone woman," a rock formation on the estate. Iskander has four children: Salman, the eldest son; Halil, a general in the army; Nilofer, the daughter whose dramatic life is most fully explored; and her married stepsister, Zeynep. Memed, Iskander's elder brother, and his lover, the Baron, also join the family. The plot coheres neatly as the stories interconnect: Nilofer married a Greek schoolteacher for whom her love cooled, leaving her miserable; when her husband is murdered, a victim of anti-Greek violence, she pursues a love affair with a barber's son. Salman is also unhappily married, to a woman in Egypt who turns against him with an almost psychopathic violence. Halil conspires with other generals in the army to overthrow the Ottoman government. The Baron, a trained Hegelian scholar, holds forth, pedantically, on the roots of Ottoman decay. Ali's epic combines the luxuriant pacing of the old-fashioned novel of ideas with the 20th-century relish for sexual detail to conjure up an almost Chekhovian milieu. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Street cops</h2><p>love cops and the street...this baby is for you!</p><p></p><h2>Reed Organ: Its Design and Construction</h2><p>Barand New.

However, Gordon Bridger encourages us to study and apply these three Old Testament prophets for several compelling reasons. As part of Scripture, endorsed by Jesus, they claim to bring a message from God, and teach us some major truths: the importance of focusing on God, who is personal, sovereign, righteous and loving; of facing up to sin and judgment; of responding in repentance and faith; and of the hope of future salvation and restoration. They also relate to the real world, in touch with the social and political issues of their day (the seventh century BC), as well as spiritual and moral issues: sleaze amongst political leaders, unfaithfulness of religious leaders, national and personal pride, crimes against humanity and persecution of God&#39;s people. Hence, these challenging books tackle themes and issues, expounded here with clarity and conviction, which are especially relevant to today&#39;s church and world.</p><p><strong>Gordon Bridger,</strong> now retired, ministered in churches in London, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Norwich, and was principal of Oak Hill College, London, from 1987 to 1996.

Brought up in a poor Brooklyn neighborhood and originally named Lena Krasner by her immigrant parents, she decided early on to create a new name and a new identity for herself. Later, as one of the few female painters in the aggressively male circle of Abstract Expressionists, she had to contend not only with the critics' skepticism about their new way of making art but also with the skepticism that greeted any woman's attempts to become a professional artist.<br> <br>Many of Krasner's male colleagues &#x2014; including her husband, Jackson Pollock &#x2014; developed a unique "signature" style that identified them throughout their careers. Krasner, however, experimented with one style after another, from her early geometric abstractions (created while she was one of Hans Hofmann's most talented students), through her large-scale organic images of mid-career, to the hard-edge compositions of her late years. Certain elements recur throughout &#x2014; most notably, her distinctive sense of color, her affinity for swelling forms inspired by nature, and her fearlessness in experimenting with new techniques.<br> <br>Krasner's unwillingness to stick to one style, her readiness to put her career aside to focus on Pollock's, and her feuds with some of the period's most powerful critics all reduced her visibility in the art world. She has been the subject of exhibition catalogs, but this is the first monograph devoted to her work, and it brings to light all the intriguing complexities of her approach to making art. Dr. Robert Hobbs skillfully explores the twists and turns of her career, offering new information and insight about one of the most intriguing painters of the postwar era.<br> <br> <b>About the Modern Masters series:<br> <br> </b>With informative, enjoyable texts and over 100 illustrations &#x2014; approximately 48 in full color &#x2014; this innovative series offers a fresh look at the most creative and influential artists of the postwar era. The authors are highly respected art historians and critics chosen for their ability to think clearly and write well. Each handsomely designed volume presents a thorough survey of the artist's life and work, as well as statements by the artist, an illustrated chapter on technique, a chronology, lists of exhibitions and public collections, an annotated bibliography, and an index. Every art lover, from the casual museumgoer to the serious student, teacher, critic, or curator, will be eager to collect these Modern Masters. And with such a low price, they can afford to collect them all.<br></p><p>At nearly every stage of her 15-year marriage to the universally recognized Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner was quicker to respond to stylistic innovations in the art world than her husband. Pollock either didn't catch on to the art-world developments that surrounded him or incorporated changes much later than Krasner did. Some critics read Krasner's dynamic painting style as evidence of her superiority as an artist, but others saw her porousness as a problem, and Pollock's comparative insularity as one key to his uniqueness. In <i>Lee Krasner</i>, Robert Hobbs gracefully analyzes the many forces--of personality, education, and cultural and political milieu--that shaped Krasner's 60-year devotion to art; in the process, he elucidates the many reasons her "artistically constructed self remains provisional."<p> B.H. Friedman, Pollock's first biographer, introduces the book with a gripping series of intimate, you-are-there diary entries from the long years of his friendship with the two artists. Then Hobbs weaves biography and critical interpretation to develop the main text of the book. The reproductions of Krasner's drawings and paintings (97 in color) are excellent, giving a fair picture of her long career, and there are more than a score of black-and-white archival photos of Krasner and the other early abstract expressionists. The book has a few odd omissions though, such as any reference to Mark Tobey, whose "white writing" paintings and others are so closely related stylistically to Krasner's work of the 1940s. Still, this is the respectful but objective book Krasner's vigorous work and forceful personality deserve. It sheds sympathetic light on her lifelong, intellectually rigorous, artistic questing. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>This is a complete reappraisal of Lee Krasner (1908-1984), who, along with her husband, Jackson Pollock, was among the artists who launched the New York School of painting after World War II. One of the few critically recognized female Abstract Expressionists of her generation, she has emerged as an essential figure in postwar American art. This lavishly illustrated book, the companion to a major traveling exhibition, takes a fresh look at Krasner and highlights the striking originality and complexity of her work. Krasner saw her art as an open-ended exploration and a dialogue with a wide range of artistic, literary, and cultural voices. Complete with never-before-published excerpts from the diary of writer B. H. Friedman, a longtime associate of Krasner&#39;s who provides priceless insights into this pivotal period of American history, this book is essential for any art library. This book and the exhibition it accompanies were developed by Independent Curators International (ICI), a non-profit organization that creates innovative, provocative traveling exhibitions of contemporary art that have been presented in museums and university galleries worldwide. 105 illustrations, 80 in full color, 9 x 12&#34; Robert Hobbs is Rhoda Thalhimer Professor of Art History at Virginia Commonwealth University.

This was especially the case in New Jersey, the last northern state to pass an abolition statute, in 1804. Because of the nature of the law, which freed children born to enslaved mothers only after they had served their mother's master for more than two decades, slavery continued in New Jersey through the Civil War. Passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 finally destroyed its last vestiges.</p><p><i>The Ragged Road to Abolition</i> chronicles the experiences of slaves and free blacks, as well as abolitionists and slaveholders, during slavery's slow northern death. Abolition in New Jersey during the American Revolution was a contested battle, in which constant economic devastation and fears of freed blacks overrunning the state government limited their ability to gain freedom. New Jersey's gradual abolition law kept at least a quarter of the state's black population in some degree of bondage until the 1830s. The sustained presence of slavery limited African American community formation and forced Jersey blacks to structure their households around multiple gradations of freedom while allowing New Jersey slaveholders to participate in the interstate slave trade until the 1850s. Slavery's persistence dulled white understanding of the meaning of black freedom and helped whites to associate "black" with "slave," enabling the further marginalization of New Jersey's growing free black population.</p><p>By demonstrating how deeply slavery influenced the political, economic, and social life of blacks and whites in New Jersey, this illuminating study shatters the perceived easy dichotomies between North and South or free states and slave states at the onset of the Civil War.</p></p><p>James J. Gigantino II is Associate Professor of History at the University of Arkansas.<p>"This magisterial volume sets the standard for examining slavery in New Jersey politics, economy, and society.

Eschewing a good deal of his father's no-numbers approach, Ken popularized the use of the price/sales ratio (PSR) and price/research ratio (PRR) in this 1984 classic that earned him a permanent spot as a columnist in <i>Forbes</i>. Although Fisher hardly invented the price/sales ratio, his emphasis of it is unmatched in investment history, save perhaps Ernie Kiehne, formerly of Legg Mason's Value Fund. <p> Fisher's <i>Super Stocks</i> is an idiosyncratic romp through the technology heyday of the early '80s. Fisher tells story after story of how high-fliers hit a short-term flame-out he called the "glitch" and the price/sales ratio and price/research ratio got him in at the bottom. Although he only gives quantitative price/sales ratios on technology-related stocks for the 1983 and 1984 time frame, his ability to construct an entire approach to valuation outside of the earnings-preoccupied mainstream still makes for compelling reading. Fisher has not completely escaped his father, though. The guy talks about the businesses he buys in lurid detail, advising investors that to be successful they need to do the same.

She meets a spiritually frustrated treasure hunter who&#x2014;believing Joelle to be a male&#x2014;invites her to join a wagon train to gold-rich California. But hard living on the trail makes it harder for Joelle to conceal her identity. When her traveling companion learns the truth, matters of faith and friendship become tense until Joelle helps him realize that God can indeed do all things, and that some things&#x2014;like true love&#x2014;are worth even more than gold.</p></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>Gilbert Morris is among today&#x2019;s most popular Christian writers; his books having sold nearly six million copies worldwide.

Sadie's friend, mediocre musician Danny Noonan, is determined to track down the one person who may be able to snap her back to reality: her mother. But he'll have to stay one step ahead of the hit men sent by Sadie's pervert father, the billionaire owner of the Brown Bag Superstore chain. And then there's Sadie's obsession with the idea that Spiders from Mars are gathering an army to colonize Earth. At first, Danny is convinced it's all a delusion caused by her brain injury, but the more he sees, the less sure he becomes of what's reality and what's fantasy. Along for the ride are Sadie and Danny's ragtag group of misfit friends: male cross-dresser Donnie, rock star groupie and syphilis survivor CeeCee and cranky bulimic Annie. Lapham's hardcore, post-punk world is a gritty one, full of deviants, liars and killers.

By contrast, today's American suburbanites are typically privileged commuters who have fled the inner city for a backyard and domestic privacy. Unknown to the premodern city where workplaces and residences were integrated, suburbia, as this searching study notes, is a middle-class invention. Fishman, a Rutgers professor of history, makes us keenly aware that modern, class-segregated suburbs represent a total transformation of urban values. Separate chapters cover Philadelphia's late 19th century suburbs and Los Angeles, the apex of the trend toward suburbia. Fishman is disturbed by the new perimeter cities or "technoburbs," where industrial parks, shopping malls and telecommunications have supplanted face-to-face contact. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Mix-it-up Cookbook (American Girl Library)</h2><p>Includes recipes for several types of food, including pizza, pasta, and ice cream, and provides &#34;Chef&#39;s Journal&#34; sidebars to help keep track of notes and favorite dishes.</p><p></p><h2>Mcknight&#39;s Physical Geography a Landscape Appreciation Tenth Edition</h2><p>This is an international book edition in perfect condition.

Harjo's selections from six previous books from The Last Song (1975) to A Map to the Next World: Poems and Tales (2000), show the remarkable progression of a writer determined to reconnect with her past and make sense of her present, drawing together the brutalities of contemporary reservation life with the beauty and sensibility of Native American culture and mythology: "But I imagined her like this, not a stained red dress with tape on her heels but the deer who entered our dream in white dawn, breathed mist into pine trees, her fawn a blessing of meat, the ancestors who never left." At times, the juxtaposition of the two carries an almost visceral power of regenerative rhythm, most powerfully in the poems from She Had Some Horses: "She had horses who liked Creek Stomp Dance songs. She had horses who cried in their beer. She had horses who spit at male queens who made them afraid of themselves. She had horses who said they weren't afraid. She had horses who lied. She had horses who told the truth, who were stripped bare of their tongues." Such moments have a decided a political piquancy. Harjo, who belongs to the Muscogee Nation, includes a long introduction, as well as extensive notes on the origins of and elements in each poem, and contends that poetry is not only a way to save the sanity of those who have been oppressed to the point of madness, but that it is a tool to rebuild communities and, ultimately, change the world: "All acts of kindness are lights in the war for justice." Alive with compassion, pain and love, this book is unquestionably an act of kindness.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity</h2><p>This book provides an in-depth historical study of the place of Jesus in the religious life, beliefs, and worship of Christians from the beginnings of the Christian movement down to the late second century.</p><p>This outstanding book provides an in-depth historical study of the place of Jesus in the religious life, beliefs, and worship of Christians from the beginnings of the Christian movement down to the late second century.<p>"Lord Jesus Christ" is a monumental work on earliest Christian devotion to Jesus, sure to replace Wilhelm Bousset's "Kyrios Christos" (1913) as the standard work on the subject. Larry Hurtado, widely respected for his previous contributions to the study of the New Testament and Christian origins, offers the best view to date of how the first Christians saw and reverenced Jesus as divine. In assembling this compelling picture, Hurtado draws on a wide body of ancient sources, from Scripture and the writings of such figures as Ignatius of Antioch and Justin to apocryphal texts such as the "Gospel of Thomas" and the "Gospel of Truth."</p><p>Hurtado considers such themes as early beliefs about Jesus' divine status and significance, but he also explores telling devotional practices of the time, including prayer and worship, the use of Jesus' name in exorcism, baptism and healing, ritual invocation of Jesus as "Lord," martyrdom, and lesser-known phenomena such as prayer postures and the curious scribal practice known today as the "nomina sacra."</p><p>The revealing portrait that emerges from Hurtado's comprehensive study yields definitive answers to questions like these: How important was this formative period to later Christian tradition? When did the divinization of Jesus first occur? Was early Christianity influenced by neighboring religions? How did the idea of Jesus' divinity change old views of God? And why did the powerful dynamics of early beliefs and practices encouragepeople to make the costly move of becoming a Christian? </p><p>Boasting an unprecedented breadth and depth of coverage -- the book speaks authoritatively on everything from early Christian history to themes in biblical studies to New Testament Christology -- Hurtado's "Lord Jesus Christ" is at once significant enough that a wide range of scholars will want to read it and accessible enough that general readers interested at all in Christian origins will also profit greatly from it.</p>Larry W. Hurtado is Professor of New Testament Language, Literature, and Theology at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.</p><h2>Beyond the Notches: Stories of Place in New Hampshire&#39;s North Country</h2><p>An award-winning anthology of more than fifty original essays capturing the history, spirit and resilience of New Hampshire&#39;s rugged North Country.

Now paper heroines are generally brave and resourceful, but, alas, many of the books aren't memorable. Enter Erica Bauermeister and Holly Smith (<i>500 Great Books by Women</i>), book-lovers who collected fiction, biography, and poetry with girls aged 2-14 in mind. They have culled a stellar group of 375 titles divided into picture books, storybooks, chapter books, and more complex writings.

In <i>The Odds</i>, Chad Millman follows three professional gamblers through a year of college basketball, where meticulous research, betting discipline, and instinct clash with addiction, and no one relaxes until they've lost it all.<p> The three colorful gamblers Millman expertly portrays are a high-rolling career "wiseguy," a slacker wannabe, and a bookmaker who sets the lines on games (for example, Iowa over Indiana by 4-1/2 points, meaning if you bet on Iowa, you win only if Iowa wins by five points or more). The idea behind the betting line is to lure bets (hopefully, losing ones) and make a profit for his casino from the action, but more importantly to stay ahead of those who pounce on a weak line like hungry wolves. Millman provides the answer to what makes these wiseguys tick: "While the casual bettor weighs common sense and financial realities with every bet, the wiseguy pushes those aside... [his] battle isn't with what makes sense; his battle is with anyone who gets in the way of making his bet a euphoric experience."</p><p> Along with lurid details of what these gamblers do to feed their frenzy, Millman enriches us on gambling's history and sobering statistics, on Vegas's decline and the rise of offshore casinos, and on the effects of media coverage and politics on sports and gambling. While you won't learn how to get rich off the next office pool, you will get an inside look at those who make or lose money on some kid's buzzer-beater or a garbage-time lay-up. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>Chad Millman is a contributing writer for ESPN Magazine.

Yet his work is delicately poised between scepticism and naturalism, between despair at the limited powers of the mind and optimism at the progress we can make by understanding it. This difficult balancing act has given rise to a multitude of different interpretations: reading Hume has never been free of controversy. In this new approach to his writings Simon Blackburn describes how Hume can be placed as one of the earliest, and most successful, evolutionary psychologists, weaving plausible natural accounts of the way we should think of ourselves, and of how we have come to be what we are.</p><p><p>Simon Blackburn is the author <i>Think</i>, <i>Being Good</i>, <i>Truth: A Guide for the Perplexed</i>, and <i>Plato&#x2019;s Republic</i>.<b></b></p></p><h2>Wildtrack (The Thrillers #1)</h2><p>Captain Nicholas Sandman, a crippled war hero stripped of all he loves, discovers that his beloved ketch &#34;Sycorax&#34; has been destroyed and agrees to navigate the luxury yacht &#34;Wildtrack&#34; in a perilous sea race plagued by dark secrets</p><p><p> Bernard Cornwell is the author of the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Agincourt</i>; the bestselling Saxon Tales, which include <i>The Last Kingdom</i>, <i>The Pale Horseman</i>, <i>Lords of the North</i>, and <i>Sword Song</i>; and the Richard Sharpe novels, among many others. He lives with his wife on Cape Cod. </p>Some readers may quibble at the ambiguous ending, but Cornwell's first modern-day novel, after Redcoat and the Sharpe series, works very nicely. Narrator Nick Sandman, Falkland Islands hero and Victoria Cross recipient, is determined not only to walk again after a war wound but also to sail his ketch Sycorax to New Zealand. After two years' hospitalization, he is, barely, walking again, but Nick's return to Devon finds Sycorax beached and vandalized, apparently at the behest of TV talk-show host Tony Bannister. Legal difficulties force Nick into making a TV movie for Bannister in exchange for salvaging Sycorax. Complications arise immediately: Bannister is out to win the Cherbourg-Saint Pierre race and wants Nick to be navigator; Bannister's ex-father-in-law is out to avenge his daughter's "murder" aboard Bannister's ocean racer Wildtrack and wants Nick to help; Bannister's beautiful mistress Angela is out to make that TV movie; and Nick falls in love with Angela. The climax comes with Nick racing across the Atlantic in a howling gale to prevent Bannister's murder. Even landlubbers will enjoy Cornwell's terrific pacing, colorful characters and dry humor, and perhaps, will learn a few things, too (e.g., in sailing jargon, "scuttles" means portholes).

Rees's vision of our immediate future is both a work of stunning scientific originality and a humanistic clarion call on behalf of the future of life.</p><p>Just when you've stopped worrying and learned to love the bomb, along comes Sir Martin Rees, Britain's Astronomer Royal, with teeming armies of deadly viruses, nanobots, and armed fanatics. Beyond the hazards most of us know about--smallpox, terrorists, global warming--Rees introduces the new threats of the 21st century and the unholy political and scientific alliances that have made them possible. <i>Our Final Hour</i> spells out doomsday scenarios for cosmic collisions, high-energy experiments gone wrong, and self-replicating machines that steadily devour the biosphere. If we can avoid driving ourselves to extinction, he writes, a glorious future awaits; if not, our devices may very well destroy the universe.<p> </p><blockquote>What happens here on Earth, in this century, could conceivably make the difference between a near eternity filled with ever more complex and subtle forms of life and one filled with nothing but base matter.</blockquote><p> For many technological debacles, Rees places much of the blame squarely on the shoulders of the scientists who participate in perfecting environmental destruction, biological menaces, and ever-more powerful weapons. So is there any hope for humanity? Rees is vaguely optimistic on this point, offering solutions that would require a level of worldwide cooperation humans have yet to exhibit.

Shaking her left hand, Claire picked up the receiver with her right. After asking who it was, she held it out to me, rolling her eyes. "It's God again." Her little joke. The Sultan's name was Mohammed, and he <i>was</i> more or less God to the million and a half citizens of the Republic of Saru, somewhere in the Persian Gulf. "Hello, Harry?" "Hello, sir. The answer is still no." "Have you seen the Mercedes-Benz building on Sunset Boulevard? This is a building I like very much." "Sure, Joe Fontanilla designed it. He's with the Nadel Partnership. Call <i>him</i> up." " <i>He</i> was not in <i>Time</i> magazine." "Your Highness, the only reason you want me to work for you is because I was on the cover of that magazine. I don't think that's the best reason for choosing someone to do a billion-dollar project." "'It was announced last week that American Harry Radcliffe was awarded this year's Pritzker Prize, architecture's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.'" "You're reading from the article again." "I also liked the coffeepot you designed. Come over to my hotel, Harry, and I'll give you a car." "You already gave me a car last week, sir. I can only drive one at a time. Anyway, the answer would still be no. I don't design museums." "Your friend Fanny Neville is here." My other friend, Claire Stansfield, stood with her long, naked back to me, looking out her glass doors down onto Los Angeles, way below. Claire here, Fanny at the Sultan's. The salt and pepper on my life those days. "How did that happen?" I tried to keep the word "that" noncommittal so Claire wouldn't get suspicious. "I asked your friend Fanny if she would like to do an interview with me." Fanny Neville likes two things: power and imagination. She prefers both, but will take one if the other's unavailable. I was the imagination in her life those days. We'd met in New York a couple of years before when she interviewed me for <i>Art in America.</i> I give good interviews, or <i>did</i> before I went off my rocker and had to drop out of life for a while. I was back in it now, but wasn't doing much besides commuting between these two impressive women, who both said it was time I got off my ass and did something. "Could I talk to him?" <i>"Him?</i> You mean Fanny? With pleasure." There was a pause and then she came on the line. "Hello. Are you at Claire's?" "Yes." "That always makes me feel cozy. Do you talk to her in this same voice when you call from <i>my</i> house?" "Yes." "You're an asshole, Harry. How come you didn't tell me the Sultan wants you to build his museum?" "Because I already said I wouldn't." "But you took the car he gave you?" "Sure, why not? It was a gift." "A forty-thousand-dollar gift?" "He just offered me another." "I heard." She "hmph'd" like a disgruntled old woman. "Are you coming to my house for dinner?" "Yes." Claire turned around, the sunshine from behind lighting her outline so brightly that I could barely make out her nakedness. Walking toward me, she did something with her foot, and the telephone line went dead. It took a moment to realize she'd pulled out the cord. "Talk to her on your own fucking time, Harry." &nbsp; <br> BEFORE GOING OVER TO visit Fanny and the Sultan, I drove to my favorite car wash in West Hollywood. It's run by a bunch of fags who do everything beautifully and with style. I've done some of my best thinking in car washes. Those few minutes under the mad flood and yellow brushes do things to some outlying but valuable part of my brain so that I usually emerge from those false storms wired and full of ideas. Are you familiar with the Andromeda Center in Birmingham, England? The one that brought me so much notoriety a decade ago? Born in a car wash. I remember "fixing" on the swishing arc of the windshield wiper blades on my car and, just before the hoses stopped, having the first inspiration for those juxtaposed arcs that are the heart of that justly famous building. Sitting in the Hollywood car wash, watching my new Lotus get spritzed from all sides, I was a famous man with nothing to do. I was twice divorced; once even from an anorectic fashion victim whose sole creative act in life was to spell her name with two d's. Anddrea. She liked to fuck in the morning and complain the rest of the day. We were married too long and then she left me for a much nicer man. I am not a nice man. I expect others to be nice to me, but feel nocompulsion to return the favor. Luckily enough, important people have called me a genius throughout my adult life so that I've been able to get away with an inordinate amount of rudeness, indifference, and plain bad manners. If you're ever given one wish, wish the world thinks you're a genius. Geniuses are allowed to do anything. Picasso was a big prick, Beethoven never emptied his chamber pot, and Frank Lloyd Wright stole as much money from his clients and sponsors as any good thief. But it was all okay finally because they were "geniuses." Maybe they were, and I am too, but I'll tell you something: Genius is a boat that sails itself. All you have to do is get in and it does the rest, i.e., I didn't spend months and years thinking up the shapes and forms of my most renowned buildings. They came out of nowhere and my only job was to funnel them onto pieces of paper. I'm not being modest. The ideas come like breezes through a window and all you do is capture them. Braque said this: "One's style--it is in a way one's inability to do otherwise ... . Your physical constitution practically determines the shape of the brushmarks." He was right. Bullshit on all that artistic suffering, "agonizing" over the empty page, canvas ... . Anyone who agonizes over their work isn't a genius. Anyone who agonizes for a living is an idiot. Halfway through the second rinse (my favorite part came next--the dry off, when curtains of brown rags descended and slid sensuously across every surface of the car), everything stopped. My beautiful new blue Lotus (compliments of the Sultan) sat there dripping water, going nowhere. Checking the rearview mirror, I saw the car behind me was stopped too. The driver and I made eye contact. He shrugged. Trapped in a gay car wash! A few moments twiddling my fingers on the steering wheel, then I watched a couple of workers run by close on the right and out the other end. Another glance in the rearview mirror, the guy behind shrugging again. I got out of the car and, looking toward the exit,saw some kind of large commotion going on up there. I walked toward it. "What kinda car is dat?" "Fuck the car, Leslie, the guy's dead!" A brown car (I remember thinking it was the same color as the drying rags) sat a few feet from the exit. Four or five people stood around, looking inside. The driver's door was open and the manager of the place was hunched down next to it. He looked at me and asked if I was a doctor--the guy inside had had a heart attack or something, and was dead. Immediately I said yes because I wanted to see. Going over, I knelt down next to the manager. Despite having just been cleaned, the car still smelled of loaded ashtrays and wet old things. A middle-aged man sat slumped over the steering wheel. Remembering my television shows, I made like a doctor and put a hand on his throat to feel for a pulse. Nothing there under jowls and whiskery skin. "He's gone. Did you call an ambulance?" The manager nodded and we stood up together. "How do you think it happened, Doctor?" "Heart attack, probably. But best to let the ambulance men figure it out." "What a way to go, huh? Okay, Leslie and Kareem, give me a hand pushing this car out of here so we can let the rest of these people through. Thanks, Doctor. Sorry to inconvenience you." "No problem." I turned to go back to my car. "How embarrassing." "Excuse me?" I looked at him. "I mean I run this place and all, right? But I was thinking how humiliating it'd be to know that you'd die in a car wash--especially if you were famous! Imagine how your obituary would read: 'Graham Gibson, renowned actor, was found dead in The Eiffel Towel Car Wash, Thursday, after having apparently suffered a massive heart attack.'" He looked at me and grimaced. <i>"Washed</i> to death!" "I know what you mean." An <i>enormous</i> understatement. Some people fantasize their names on magazine covers, others on bronze plaques mounted on the sides of buildings. I did too, until some of those things happened to me. Then I started imagining what my obituary would say. I once read that the man who did the obituaries for the <i>New York Times</i> wrote them before people died (if they were well-known) and only polished them with final details after the person croaked. That was understandable and I could see the logic to it, but the "polish" part was disturbing. Okay, you live a long and illustrious life, full of genuine accomplishments and praise. But then what happens? You finish, looking like a big dope if you're unfortunate enough to die choking on a bottle cap, or a tree branch hits you on the head and puts you down for the count. Tennessee Williams with the bottle cap, Odon Von Horvath with the tree. I know nothing about Odon except he was a writer and that's how he died--hit on the head by a branch while walking down a street in Paris. I could too easily imagine someone saying, "I know nothing about Harry Radcliffe except he was an architect who died of a heart attack in a car wash." The <i>Eiffel Towel</i> Car Wash, no less. Walking back to the car, I reminded myself of the fact that I hadn't been doing anything with my days recently, so if it <i>had</i> been me keeled over in that brown car, my whole life would have looked pretty pointless. "What happened up there?" The man in the car behind mine was out and standing now. "A guy had a heart attack and died." <i>"Here?"</i> He shook his head and smiled. I knew what he was thinking and it made me even more depressed: It <i>was</i> funny. People would grin if you said you were at the car wash today and someone died while on his final rinse. They'd smile the same way as this man, and thenthere'd be one of those half-funny, half-fearful discussions at the dinner table about good and bad ways of dying. Venasque used to say down deep we all know we're kind of silly and thus spend too much of our lives either trying to cover it up or disprove it--mostly to ourselves. "But then when it comes to dying," he would say, "you know you might end up looking more ridiculous than ever. Even though you're dead and won't be <i>around</i> to see people's reactions, you're still afraid to look bad. Why do you think people like expensive coffins and funerals so much? So we can try being impressive, right into the ground." &nbsp; <br> FIVE MINUTES LATER, PULLING up at a stoplight on Sunset Boulevard, I looked to my left, and who was sitting in the car next to mine? Markus Hebenstreit! Architecture critic for the <i>L.A. Eye,</i> Hebenstreit was my most vicious and long-standing enemy/critic. He'd probably written more bad things about my work than anyone else. The more famous I became, the more Hebenstreit frothed and spread his verbal rabies wherever he could. "Markus!" He turned slowly and looked at me with great Hoch Deutsch disdain. When I registered on him, his contempt turned into beady-eyed hatred. "Hello, Radcliffe. Coming back from your weekly shock treatment?" "A new billion-dollar project, Markus! Man wants me to build him a <i>billion-</i>dollar museum. Do it however I want, just so long as it's an original Harry Radcliffe. "Just think, Markus, no matter <i>what</i> you write, there'll always be someone who wants me to build them billion-dollar buildings! "So suck on that a while, you Nazi fuck!" Before he could say anything, I slapped the Lotus into gear and peeled out, feeling gloriously like an eighteen-year-old. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> RUMOR HAD IT THE Sultan of Saru owned the Westwood Muse Hotel, which explained why he and his entourage invariably stayed there when they came to Los Angeles five or six times a year. It was designed and built in the 1930s by a student of Peter Behrens and looked sort of like the jazzy factories Behrens designed for AEG in Germany. I liked the place because it was quirky, but couldn't understand why the Sultan would buy it when he could have so easily afforded <i>any</i> real estate within a ten-mile radius of the Beverly Hills Hotel. When I pulled up in front, an extremely tall black woman dressed in a dove-gray shirt and slacks stepped forward and opened my door. As usual, I looked up at her in pure appreciation. She was exquisite. "Hello, Lucia." "Hello, Harry. Has he invited you again?" "Summoned." She nodded and took my place in the car. The two complemented each other perfectly; the machine should have been hers on the basis of looks and stature alone. But it wasn't. Lucia was only another beautiful failure in California, parking cars. "He still wants you to build his museum?" "Yup." "And you don't want to do it?" Her long brown hands sat lightly on the steering wheel. She smiled up at me and that smile was a killer. I thought about answering her, but asked instead, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Not sure whether I was being serious or not, she cocked her head to one side and said, "'When I grow up'? An actress. Why?" "You'd like that carved on your tombstone? 'Lucia Armstrong, actress'?" "That would make me very happy. What about you, Harry? What do you want written, 'Harry Radcliffe, celebrated architect'?" "Naah, that's too banal. Maybe 'The Man Who Built the Dog Museum.'" Said like that, the idea suddenly tickled the hell out of me. Walking up the gravel path, I turned to say something else to Lucia but she was already pulling away. I shouted to the back of my blue car, "That'd be a damned good epitaph!" Was it because of the dead man in the car wash? Being able to throw the power of "a billion dollars" in Hebenstreit's face? Or simply envisioning (and liking) the words "The Man Who Built the Dog Museum" on my gravestone that did it? Whatever the reason, walking in the front door of the Westwood Muse Hotel, I knew I would design the Sultan's museum for him, although I had been saying no for months. What I had to do next was get him to think he was not just lucky, but <i>blessed</i> to have me and, consequently, fork over the money I'd need both for myself and the project. A lot more money than even <i>he'd</i> imagined. &nbsp; <br> WHAT ARE YOUR EARLIEST memories?" Was the first question Fanny Neville asked me, the day we met and did our interview years before. I hadn't even had the chance to sit back down after letting her in. Without thinking, I said, "Seeing Sputnik and Rocket Monroe at the Luxor Baths in New York." "How old were you?" "Three, I think." "Who were Sputnik and Rocket Monroe?" &amp;q...</p><h2>The Pleasure Prescription: To Love, to Work, to Play - Life in the Balance</h2><p>Current wisdom dictates that anything that tastes, smells, or feels good can&#39;t be good for us. But pleasure is the way to health, not a temptation away from it. In The Pleasure Prescription, Pearsall gives the antidote for &#34;delight dyslexia,&#34; his name for misreading of intensity for joy, accomplishment for worth, busyness for connection, and excitement for love.</p><p>According to Pearsall, psychologist and expert on the immune system, it isn&#39;t too much stress but too little joy that&#39;s killing people. He offers his &#34;prescription,&#34; derived from the wisdom of the Polynesian cultures: patience, connection, pleasantness, modesty and tenderness. He defines crucial areas of stress and offers practical suggestions for dealing with them. While Pearsall&#39;s voice is pleasant enough, his presentation is a bit fast, making for a clipped delivery that seems more suited to a lecture than an intimate conversation. P.B.J. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineEducational psychologist Pearsall has written a book based on the 2000-year-old Polynesian concept of Aloha, embracing the five principles of patience, unity, agreement, humility, and kindness. Aloha means to give and share the breath of life and to embrace life by sharing its sacredness with others. In contrast to Western and Eastern principles glorifying the individual or self-enlightenment, the Aloha prescription glorifies the whole. The book is in three parts: reclaiming your natural pleasure path, describing the five Aloha principles in detail, and applying the principles to daily living. It provides tests, succinct formulas, and catch phrases all designed to help you find shared joy and listen to your body's "seventh sense," which is telling you something is not right. Pearsall interweaves references to scientific studies, oceanic philosophy, anecdotes, and personal stories. Unfortunately, some footnotes are incomplete, and the bibliography contains many references ten to 20 years old. Nevertheless, Pearsall takes the quick-fix manual to a higher plane and wants us to change our mental outlook and inner core, not just glue-gunning a veneer onto our current lifestyle.<br><i>Susan E. Burdick, Reading, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Legacy of Luna: The Story of a Tree, a Woman and the Struggle to Save the Redwoods</h2><p><p>On December 18, 1999, Julia Butterfly Hill's feet touched the ground for the first time in over two years, as she descended from "Luna," a thousandyear-old redwood in Humboldt County, California.</p><p>Hill had climbed 180 feet up into the tree high on a mountain on December 10, 1997, for what she thought would be a two- to three-week-long "tree-sit." The action was intended to stop Pacific Lumber, a division of the Maxxam Corporation, from the environmentally destructive process of clear-cutting the ancient redwood and the trees around it. The area immediately next to Luna had already been stripped and, because, as many believed, nothing was left to hold the soil to the mountain, a huge part of the hill had slid into the town of Stafford, wiping out many homes.</p><p>Over the course of what turned into an historic civil action, Hill endured El Nino storms, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and the tremendous sorrow brought about by an old-growth forest's destruction. This story--written while she lived on a tiny platform eighteen stories off the ground--is one that only she can tell.</p><p>Twenty-five-year-old Julia Butterfly Hill never planned to become what some have called her--the Rosa Parks of the environmental movement. Shenever expected to be honored as one of <em>Good Housekeeping's</em> "Most Admired Women of 1998" and <em>George</em> magazine's "20 Most Interesting Women in Politics," to be featured in <em>People</em> magazine's "25 Most Intriguing People of the Year" issue, or to receive hundreds of letters weekly from young people around the world. Indeed, when she first climbed into Luna, she had no way of knowing the harrowing weather conditions and the attacks on her and her cause. She had no idea of the loneliness she would face or that her feet wouldn't touch ground for more than two years. She couldn't predict the pain of being an eyewitness to the attempted destruction of one of the last ancient redwood forests in the world, nor could she anticipate the immeasurable strength she would gain or the life lessons she would learn from Luna. Although her brave vigil and indomitable spirit have made her a heroine in the eyes of many, Julia's story is a simple, heartening tale of love, conviction, and the profound courage she has summoned to fight for our earth's legacy.</p></p><p>A young woman named Julia Butterfly Hill climbed a 200-foot redwood in December 1997. She didn't come down for 738 days. The tree, dubbed Luna, grows in the coastal hills of Northern California, on land owned by the Maxxam Corporation. In 1985 Maxxam acquired the previous landlord, Pacific Lumber, then proceeded to "liquidate its assets" to pay off the debt--in other words, clear-cut the old-growth redwood forest. Environmentalists charged the company with harvesting timber at a nonsustainable level. Earth First! in particular devised tree sit-ins to protest the logging. When Hill arrived on the scene after traveling cross-country on a whim, loggers were preparing to clear-cut the hillside where Luna had been growing for 1,000 years. <i>The Legacy of Luna</i>, part diary, part treatise, and part New Age spiritual journey, is the story of Julia Butterfly Hill's two-year arboreal odyssey. <p> The daughter of an itinerant preacher, Hill writes of her chance meeting with California logging protesters, the blur of events leading to her ascent of the redwood, and the daily privations of living in the tallest treehouse on earth. She weathers everything from El Ni�o rainstorms to shock-jock media storms. More frightening are her interactions with the loggers below, who escalate the game of chicken by cutting dangerously close to Luna (eventually succeeding at killing another activist with such tactics). "'You'd better get ready for a bad hair day!'" one logger shouts up, grimly anticipating the illegal helicopter hazing she would soon get. Celebrity environmentalists like Joan Baez and Woody Harrelson stop by, too. The notoriety has, on balance, been good to Hill and her cause. <i>George</i> magazine named her one of the "Ten Most Fascinating People in Politics," <i>Good Housekeeping</i> readers nominated her one of the "Most Admired Women" in 1998, and she was featured in <i>People</i>'s "Most Intriguing People of the Year" issue. As a result, more Americans know about controversial forestry practices; it remains to be seen, however, whether public outrage is enough to save California's unprotected and ever-shrinking groves of redwoods. While an agreement allowed Hill to descend from her aerie and Luna to escape the saw, most of the surrounding old-growth forest in the region has been felled or will fall shortly. Still, Hill is optimistic: "Luna is only one tree. We will save her, but we will lose others. The more we stand up and demand change, though, the more things will improve." <i>--Langdon Cook</i></p>It is critical to point out that Legacy of Luna is printed on paper made from 30% post-consumer recycled fibers and 70% Forestry Stewardship Council-certified paper using soy based ink. There is no more responsible paper available. It&#39;s quite insane to suggest that Julia would devote her life to saving trees only to have them sacrificed for her book. Instead, this book is a model of the sustainability available to all of us. Furthermore, it is instructive to know that she is not receiving penny from the profits of this book -- they are all going to the Circle of Life Foundation whose work is to promote sustainabiliy, restoration and preservation of life.</p><h2>Misreadings</h2><p>This is a collection of parodies by the author of &#34;The Name of the Rose&#34; and &#34;Foucault&#39;s Pendulum&#34;.

Rosenheim argues that Poe's cryptographic writing--his essays on cryptography and the short stories that grew out of them--requires that we rethink the relation of poststructural criticism to Poe's texts and, more generally, reconsider the relation of literature to communication. Cryptography serves not only as a template for the language, character, and themes of much of Poe's late fiction (including his creation, the detective story) but also as a "secret history" of literary modernity itself. "Both postwar fiction and literary criticism," the author writes, "are deeply indebted to the rise of cryptography in World War II." </p><p>Still more surprising, in Rosenheim's view, Poe is not merely a source for such literary instances of cryptography as the codes in Conan Doyle's "The Dancing-Men" or in Jules Verne, but, through his effect on real cryptographers, Poe's writing influenced the outcome of World War II and the development of the Cold War. However unlikely such ideas sound, The Cryptographic Imagination offers compelling evidence that Poe's cryptographic writing clarifies one important avenue by which the twentieth century called itself into being. </p><p>"The strength of Rosenheim's work extends to a revisionistic understanding of the entirety of literary history (as a repression of cryptography) and then, in a breathtaking shift of register, interlinks Poe's exercises in cryptography with the hyperreality of the CIA, the Cold War, and the Internet. What enables this extensive range of applications is the stipulated tension Rosenheim discerns in the relationship between the forms of the literary imagination and the condition of its mode of production. Cryptography, in this account, names the technology of literary production--the diacritical relationship between decoding and encoding--that the literary imagination dissimulates as hieroglyphics--the hermeneutic relationship between a sign and its content."--Donald E.

The Emmy Award-winning (for his special <em>The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive</em>) comedian whom the <em>Guardian </em>(London) dubbed &#x201c;a treasure of the British Empire,&#x201d; Fry joins the ranks of other humorists who have previously provided uniquely British takes on contemporary American life&#x2014;including Michael Palin and Eric Idle of Monty Python&#x2014;not to mention <em>New York Times </em>bestselling expatriate Bill Bryson. Warmhearted, eye-opening, and very, very funny <em>Stephen Fry in America </em>is a journey that is not to be missed.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>Britain's best-loved comic genius, Stephen Fry, turns his celebrated wit and insight to unearthing the real America as he travels across the continent in his chariot of Englishness, a black London cab.</p></blockquote><p>Stephen Fry has always loved America. In fact, he came very close to being born here. His fascination for the country and its people sees him embarking on an epic journey across America, visiting each of its fifty states to discover how such a huge diversity of people, cultures, languages, and beliefs creates such a remarkable nation. Stephen starts his journey on the East Coast and zigzags across America, stopping in every state from Maine to Hawaii, talking to each state's hospitable citizens, listening to music, visiting landmarks, viewing small-town life and America's breathtaking landscapes, following wherever his curiosity leads him. </p><p>En route he discovers the South Side of Chicago with blues legend Buddy Guy, catches up with Morgan Freeman in Mississippi, strides around with Ted Turner on his Montana ranch, marches with Zulus in Mardi Gras in New Orleans, drums with the Sioux Nation in South Dakota, joins a Georgia family for Thanksgiving, "picks" with bluegrass hillbillies, and finds himself in a Tennessee garden full of dead bodies.</p><p>Whether in a club for failed gangsters in Brooklyn, New York (yes, those are real bullet holes), or celebrating Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts (is there anywhere better?), Stephen is welcomed by the people of America&#x2014;mayors, sheriffs, newspaper editors, park rangers, teachers, and hoboes, bringing to life the oddities and splendors of each locale. A celebration of the magnificent and the eccentric, the beautiful and the strange, <em>Stephen Fry in America</em> is the author's homage to this extraordinary country.</p><p>Stephen Fry was born in London in 1957 and educated at Stout's Hill, Uppingham, and Queens' College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he joined the Footlights, where he first met Hugh Laurie. He has numerous television appearances to his credit, most notably, <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em>, <em>Jeeves and Wooster</em>, <em>Blackadder</em>, <em>QI</em>, and <em>House</em>. Major film roles include Peter in <em>Peter's Friends</em> (1990) and Oscar Wilde in <em>Wilde</em> (1997); in the realm of television, his critically acclaimed <em>The Secret Life of a Manic Depressive</em> won an Emmy. He is the author of the best selling novels <em>The Liar</em>, <em>The Hippopotamus</em>, <em>Making History</em>, and <em>Revenge: A Novel</em>, as well as the highly acclaimed autobiography <em>Moab Is My Washpot</em> and, in 2005, a well-received guide to writing poetry, <em>The Ode Less Travelled</em>.</p></p><h2>Two Sides of the Beach: The Invasion and Defense of Europe in 1944</h2><p>This is the story of D-Day and the Invasion of Europe as seen by both the attacking and defending forces. It includes comments and descriptions from a wide range of Allied and German forces--from generals to front-line infantry soldiers. It relates the horror of combat through the eyes of the fighting men, conveying their terror, exhaustion, and often their fury.</p><p>Edmund Blandford has flown for the RAF and written four other historical books.Edmund Blandford's book, 'Two Sides of the Beach' offers the reader an interesting insight into the British and German soldiers who were involved in the attack and defence of the Normandy beaches in 1944. This book is mainly a collection of first hand accounts provided by front line soldiers, officers and members of the General Staff. The accounts detail the fighting from the invasion on June 6th 1944, until the final Allied breakout during 'Operation Totalise'. The accounts are woven skillfully together by the author and present a fairly complete picture of the campaign as seen through the eyes of the British and Canadian 'Tommies' as well as soldiers of the German Army and Waffen-SS. By no means is this a comprehensive account of the Normandy campaign, it is more of an oral history similar in style to Gerald Astor or Lyn MacDonald and just as good. This book would blend in well and complement such campaign studies as Max Hasting's 'Overlord' (1984) or Carlo D'este's 'Decision in Normandy' (1983) as well as many other detailed histories. The beauty of this book is in the first-hand accounts provided by the participants, they are brutally honest and refreshing. They give you a real idea of what the soldiers endured during the fighting for Normandy and the subsequent breakout. The only problem that I found with this book was the total lack of maps, just a few of the area would have been appreciated. However a number of good black &amp; white photographs were provided in the book that fitted in with the story. Overall this was a most interesting account and the narrative was fast paced and well researched. I am sure that anyone who enjoys a good historical account or has a passion for the Normandy campaign will appreciate this book. --By Aussie Reader<br><br>Edmund Blanford's Two Sides Of The Beach: The Invasion And Defense Of Europe In 1944 vividly presents the story of D-Day and the Invasion of Europe from the perspectives of both the attacking and defending forces. Blanford includes comments and descriptions from a wide range of Allied and German forces ranging from the generals to front-line infantry soldiers. Two Sides Of The Beach compelling relates the horror of combat through the eyes of the fighting men and candid relates they terror, exhaustion, and the fury. Two Sides Of The Beach is "must" reading for all military buffs and students of the World War II European Theater. --By Midwest Book Review<br><br>Normally books where the author goes from first person account to account, with a brief set up in between, is not one of my favorites. However, this book is so well done and ballanced you hardly notice this style. This book only covers the German Commonwealth point of view, so no accounts of Omaha and Utah here (However plenty of references, such as the US refusal of using Hobart's funnies). The book also goes right into action with only two short chapters prior the actual invasion, and covers the time frame well beyond the beach. The American reader will need to brush up on their "English" due to the slang the British use. Overall a must read for any person who wishes a better look at the Eastern half of OVERLORD and beyond. --By Mitch Reed</p><h2>Preaching from the Old Testament</h2><p><p>This book provides theological insights as well as practical sermon suggestions for preachers and seminary students.

Now, at eighty-eight, the Pulitzer Prize winner creates his most important work on a subject few can comfortably discuss: death.<br><br>Here, in the voices of people both esteemed and unknown, are wise words, meaningful memories, and compassionate predictions about the experience of life&#x2019;s end&#x2013;and what may come after.

A Hiroshima survivor reconciles her painful memories with the stoicism of her Japanese culture . . . Actress Uta Hagan expresses how her art is her religion and will be her legacy . . .

Regular folks--ranging from the deeply religious to the deeply atheistic--share their life stories and their hopes or suspicions about the afterlife. Some are well-known, such as author Kurt Vonnegut, radio journalist Ira Glass, and folksinger Doc Watson (who, incidentally, appears in the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's classic bluegrass album <i>Will the Circle Be Unbroken</i>). Others, including parents, artists, medics, and clergymen, share equally compelling stories about losing family members, patients, and friends; personal encounters with heavenly voices; and apparitions. Terkel lies low throughout the book; his voice is only heard in the short intros to each speaker's story and in the chuckle-inducing introduction, which tells the story of an asthmatic boy--Studs, of course--who ironically outlives his family and dear wife Ida. The result is a vibrant tapestry of life's full process, sure to stir compassion and inspiration in adults at any point on the curve. <i>--Liane Thomas</i><b>&#x201c;In these moving, thought-provoking, and powerful interviews, Terkel beautifully illustrates that this book may be about death, &#x2018;but only by living to the full its long prelude, life.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Associated Press</b><i><br></i><br><b>&#x201c;TERRIFYING, MOVING, PAINFUL, AND REDEMPTIVE . . .

On the banks of Las Moras Creek, not far from the Rio Grande, they established the colony of Dolores. Among them were the British-born Sarah Ann Horn and her husband and two small sons. For the pretty Sarah Ann, who shared her neighbors' fear of Comanche raids, the year or so in Dolores was a preview of a special hell to come. The threat of an invasion by Santa Anna, an uncongenial climate, a lack of trees for lumber, an unnavigable river, crop failures, and a scarcity of commodities contributed to the colonists' discouragement and discord. <p>In <i>Comanche Bondage</i> the distinguished southwestern historian Carl Coke Rister has written the history of the Dolores enterprise, drawing on Beale's journals and other documents, and including reports of the survivors. Leaving Dolores in the wake of news about the Alamo and Goliad disasters, the Horn family and their neighbors the Harrises headed toward Matamoras. They never arrived there. Later a broken Sarah Ann Horn told the horrifying story of the murder of the men and of the years of captivity she and Mrs. Harris and their children endured at the hands of the Comanches. Rister has edited and annotated her 1839 narrative, which complements and extends his account of Beales's folly.</p></p><p>Don Worcester, who wrote the introduction for this Bison Book edition, is a professor emeritus of history at Texas Christian University and the author of many books.</p><h2>PARK CITY PUBLISHING Book Cookbook Park City Restaurants #1, 1 EA</h2><p>An culinary evening from the restaurants of Park City, Utah.

Or is there something more? In Recovering Mother Kirk, church historian Darryl Hart argues that it is impossible to gain a proper understanding of Reformed doctrine, its worldview, or its piety apart from the experience of the worshiping body of believers. Recovering Mother Kirk discusses the church&#39;s commission, contemporary worship, office and ordinances, Presbyterian parochialism, and revival. Although he writes from a Presbyterian and Reformed perspective, Hart believes that every Protestant denomination faces a pressing need to put theology into practice through worship. Anything less, he says, is a form of Christianity that will have little appeal to either spiritual seekers or regular worshipers. Hart attempts to restore the balance between sound doctrine, which is vital to the health of the church, and sound practice. He argues that historically, members of the Reformed tradition have emphasized doctrine to the detriment of practice. In a postmodern world that craves connectedness, the need to restore the vitality of the worshiping faith community has never been more urgent. Recovering Mother Kirk is a thought-provoking manifesto that will be useful to pastors and laypeople within the Presbyterian and Reformed tradition, as well as those who seek to gain a greater appreciation for the relationship between doctrine and the public worship of the church.</p><p>D. G. Hart (Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University) is academic dean and professor of church history at Westminster Theological Seminary in California.Liturgical Presbyterians? No, this is not an oxymoron. D. G. Hart has written a lively polemic against the well-intentioned dumbing-down of worship by advocates of church growth. This book is going to make some people very mad, and it will make others very glad. Those who have thrown away the theological substance of the great Reformed tradition of Christian worship ought to be mad. Hart shames them. And yet, for those whose privilege it is to praise and serve God in a church that enjoys the Reformed way of worship in all its depth, glory, and joy, this book is a great summons to faithfulness in our time. --WILLIAM H. WILLIMON, Duke Divinity School<br><br>Beginning to realize just how much they have been shaped by non-Reformed influences, conservative Presbyterian and Reformed churches are now being forced to decide between a generic 'low-church' Protestantism, a 'high church' tradition, or, oddly enough, a more traditional Reformed and Presbyterian approach. D. G. Hart believes that Reformed theology provides resources not only for understanding that we are saved, but also for how we worship and mature in the Christian faith. There's a lot of wisdom here, and whether one agrees or disagrees with Hart, his well-considered arguments cannot be responsibly ignored by adherents of Reformed Christianity. --MICHAEL HORTON, Editor in Chief, Modern Reformation<br><br>Unabashedly writing to inform, rouse, and serve his fellow Presbyterians, D. G. Hart has nonetheless produced a book that is properly and profoundly ecumenical. Christians from all communions who take seriously the identity and nature of the church will learn from Hart's analysis of the complex arrangement under God of cult and culture, form and content, church and state, praise and proclamation, cross and crown. Hart reminds us that the chronicles of the people of God always offer encouragement to strengthen feeble arms, weak knees, and lazy minds. --KEN MYERS, host and producer of the Mars Hill Audio Journal</p><h2>The Throw-Away Bride (Golden Spurs)</h2><p><br><br>Abby Collins wasn't in the habit of having one-night stands. Especially with strong but staid ranchers like Leo Storm. Their night together had been wilder than she'd ever imagined, but it had consequences that Abby hadn't bargained for. She was pregnant...with Leo's baby. He'd asked her to marry him&#x2014;said it would make things easier. And while marriage to a wealthy CEO would make some women swoon, Abby really only wanted for her and her baby to be loved. And that was the one thing Leo might not be capable of....<br><br></p><p>Besides writing, Ann enjoys her husband, kids, grandchildren, cats, hobbies, and travels.&nbsp; A Texan, Ann holds a B.A. from UT, and an M.A. from Texas A&nbsp;&amp; M.&nbsp; A former teacher on both&nbsp; the secondary and college levels,&nbsp; Ann is an experienced speaker.&nbsp; She's written over 60 books for Dell, Silhouette Romance, Special Edition, Intimate Moments, Desire and Mira and frequently makes bestseller lists.<i>Central Texas, near Austin</i><p><i>Abigail Colins's ranch outside Bastrop, Texas</i></p><p><i>Early morning, first of June</i></p><p>Predictable Leo Storm had seemed like a safe choice.</p><p><i>When you go to a bar on the rebound intending to dance with a wild cowboy or two, and you end up sleeping with the dullest, safest, most-buttoned-down guy there&#x2014;your next-door neighbor of all people&#x2014;you don't expect earth-shattering consequences... in his bed or afterward.</i></p><p>Abigail Collins's eyes burned, and not from mucking out her horse Coco's stall. She was suffering from a bad case of Poor-Me Syndrome.</p><p>Greedy, ambitious CEOs like Leo Storm were supposed to play it safe when it came to sex. They were supposed to carry wallets full of condoms and fall asleep after doing it once.</p><p>Apparently Leo hadn't read his CEO rule book on said subject. His skill and enthusiastic ardor as a lover had made Abigail's toes tingle and her bones melt. She'd opened herself to him in ways that had caused her to despise herself and blame him the next morning. They'd done it so many times, she'd been tender for days. Needless to say, she'd avoided the heck out of him ever since.</p><p>So, the discovery that she was pregnant&#x2014;by Leo&#x2014; sucked big-time.</p><p><i>You can have anything you want&#x2014;as long as you're willing to pay the price, </i>her mother used to say. Trouble was, the price was due, and Abby didn't want to pay.</p><p>Ever since she'd found out about her condition last week, she'd been wallowing in self-misery&#x2014;not that she was proud of such childish behavior.</p><p>As soon as she'd gotten up this morning and had finished going to the bathroom, desperation had overwhelmed her again, and she'd flipped the toilet lid down and collapsed on it, sniveling like a baby. A little later she'd had another good cry while knocking her forehead against the wet tiles of her shower.</p><p>As if buckets full of tears or regrets&#x2014;and don't forget whining&#x2014;did any good. Some things just had to be faced.</p><p>Pregnant! By Leo Storm!</p><p><i>She was a control freak and single with no desire for a long-term alliance of any kind after being hurt so badly when her boyfriend, Shanghai Knight, had dumped her.</i></p><p>Since puberty she'd gone for short-term relationships with cowboys like Shanghai; not for boring, bossy, calculating, corporate, money guys without souls like Leo. She'd been the brains, and the cowboys been the brawn.</p><p>She licked her lips and wiped the sweat off her brow. Well, she wasn't going to cry again. No use indulging in any more pity parties. She was a big girl&#x2014;whether she was acting like one or not. She could handle this. She <i>had </i>to handle this.</p><p>Which was why she was telling Leo today. Surely she'd feel better once that was behind her. She closed her eyes and tried not to think about Leo's white, drawn face and blazing black eyes the last time she'd seen him. He'd been furious at her. Not only furious&#x2014;he'd said he was through with her.</p><p>Usually being in the barn with Coco, her gentle palomino, soothed her. Not today. Not when she dreaded driving into San Antonio and telling a certain stubborn, macho CEO, who was now refusing to take her calls, that <i>they </i>had a little problem.</p><p>Every time she bent over to scoop another pitchfork load of manure and dirty straw into the wheelbarrow, the zipper of her jeans slid a little lower, reminding her of <i>their </i>mutual problem and <i>that </i>night, that one night with him that she'd tried so hard to forget.</p><p>Not that he'd wanted to forget. He'd made it very clear he'd wanted her&#x2014;again and again. He was nothing if not determined. He'd called her both at home and at her office. He'd dropped by, but finally when she'd rejected him for about the tenth time, he'd become so angry he'd issued his ultimatum&#x2014;which she'd ignored.</p><p>Having rid himself of her, he wouldn't be happy to learn that <i>that </i>night was now every bit as impossible for her to forget as it had been for him.</p><p>Heaving in a breath, she rested her pitchfork against the wheelbarrow and tugged her zipper back up. She was panting by the time she'd managed it, so she didn't even try to snap the waistband. The jeans had been tight when she'd bought them, but since she'd planned to take off a couple of pounds, she hadn't worried about it.</p><p>No chance of losing those pounds anytime soon.</p><p>As she stooped to pick up the pitchfork, the cell phone in her back pocket vibrated against her hip. She threw the pitchfork back down hard, and it stabbed a mound of hay so violently that Coco, who was just outside the stall, danced backward, her hooves clattering on the concrete floor.</p><p>Oh, God, what if her big darling slipped because of her thoughtlessness?</p><p>"Easy girl," she whispered, her tone gentle even as the stench of straw and urine and horse in such close quarters caused nausea to roil in her stomach.</p><p>She hoped against hope that Leo had relented and was returning her call like a reasonable individual. Maybe he'd even agree to stop by her ranch house tonight to talk. Much as she would dread seeing him, it would be so nice if she could avoid the drive to San Antonio and the humiliation of fighting her way into his office after he'd made it clear he never wanted to see her again.</p><p>Not that she could blame him for that. Her heart knocked as she remembered accusing him of not being able to take no for an answer and of stalking her. He'd hissed in a breath. But she'd seen the acute pain in his black eyes right before he'd whirled, pitched the roses he'd brought her into the trash and quietly walked back to his truck. Later he'd called her and had delivered his ultimatum, which, for some weird reason, she'd replayed at least a dozen times in her mind. Did she enjoy suffering or what?</p><p>Instead of Leo's name, the number of In the Pink!, Abigail's own company located on a side street just off Congress Avenue in downtown Austin lit up the blue LED of her mobile phone.</p><p>Kel, her executive secretary, best friend, unpaid therapist... and of late, her number-one shoulder to cry on, was calling.</p><p><i>Damn.</i></p><p>Abigail sagged against the wall of the barn. A tear rolled down her cheek as she caught her breath. Then she swallowed and squeaked out a hello that she'd meant to sound chirpy.</p><p>"Hey, Abby, do you have a cold or something?"</p><p>"Or something." Abigail felt frozen. "This thing has me all messed up."</p><p>"I know. Hormones."</p><p>Or the terror of Leo Storm, of what he would say and do to her this morning at her news, especially after the way she'd treated him.</p><p>"Other than feeling like I'm about to have a nervous breakdown, I'm fine. Never better." Somehow she managed a hollow laugh. "As fine as someone with morning sickness can be, mucking out a stall... before they face a firing squad."</p><p>"You need to hire somebody for that yucky-mucky stuff now."</p><p>A city girl through and through, Kel didn't get horses.</p><p>"I know. You're right. I will."</p><p>"So, anything I need to know before I start scheduling your day?"</p><p>"Yes. I-I'm going to tell him... today."</p><p>"Oh? When exactly?"</p><p>"This morning! First thing!"</p><p>"Wow. Well, finally!"</p><p>"Putting it off is driving me crazy. The only problem is it looks like I'm going to have to track him down. He won't return my calls."</p><p>"You should have listened to your smart secretary. Didn't I tell you, you should call him and apologize&#x2014;"</p><p>"Smart-assed secretary!"</p><p>"Big-assed, too." Kel laughed. "And getting bigger. Jan brought in two dozen donuts this morning coated with yummy strawberry goo. I'm inhaling my second."</p><p>"Okay. Well, I didn't call him back or apologize. And ever since, he's avoided the ranch and me. Now he won't even take my calls or call me back."</p><p>"Why are we surprised?"</p><p>"I said it was urgent. I've left several messages with his secretary, too. Yesterday, she actually got snappy and said he had no intention of returning my calls. I can't tell you how humiliating that was. I'm not about to tell a witch like her to tell him I'm pregnant with his child, so I guess I have to drive over there."</p><p>"Right. You think you'll getbackhere this afternoon?"</p><p>"After lunch. I'll probably be a basket case after seeing him."</p><p>"Do you want me to cancel your afternoon?"</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"Is there anything I can do?" Kel's voice was soft with concern.</p><p>"Just be your smart-assed self and put out any and all home fires."</p><p>"Don't worry about us," Kel said. "Just take care of you."</p><p>They hung up.</p><p>Abigail's hands began to shake again as she slid her phone in her back pocket. Compulsively, she began marching back and forth in the barn, straightening tack that didn't need to be straightened, lining up bottles and brushes on shelves, trying to feel she controlled something. She got a broom and began to sweep the feed that Coco had shaken out of the feed sack when she'd grabbed it by her teeth earlier.</p><p>Coco walked up and lowered her head almost apologetically. It was her way of begging for her favorite treat, a mixture of oats and molasses.</p><p>"Not today, big girl. Not after this big mess you made!"</p><p>Setting the broom against the wall, Abby pushed the wheelbarrow full of dirty straw outside the barn and up a small hill where she dumped it before heading toward the house. Coco, who adored her, trailed behind her in the hope of being stroked or fed, but Abby was too distracted to notice her as she usually did.</p><p>Pregnant! By Leo....</p><p>Even though Abigail had taken the pregnancy tests a week ago&#x2014;three of them&#x2014;she still couldn't believe she was in this mess. She was a businesswoman, an entrepreneur with a staff of forty, the owner of her own ranch. Make that a ranchette. But still... she was <i>la capitana </i>of her ship! Even if she'd sailed headlong into the rocks.</p><p>She reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. Quickly she scrolled down to Leo's cell number and punched it. Once again she listened to it ring until his voice mail picked up. So, he still refused to answer. She flipped her phone shut and began to pace.</p><p>So what else was new? She'd watched him screen his calls, so it was easy to imagine his black eyes grimly eyeing her name before his jaw tightened and he thrust...</p></p><h2>Show Me How: Knitting: Knitting Storybook &amp; How-to-Knit Instructions</h2><p>Meet Mary Ruth she and her brother Jacob are going to Grandma&#x2019;s house for the weekend.

Now that the decision had been made, it would be a long time before things settled down to the merely ordinary again. She could only hope she was doing the right thing.<br><br>In the quiet, animal-scented air of the barn, Abby saddled her horse. Maybe it was wrong to steal this time in the middle of the day when there was still so much to be done, but she needed it. An hour alone, away from the house, away from obligations, seemed like an enormous luxury.<br><br>Abby hesitated, then shook her head and fastened the cinch. If you were going to steal, you might as well go for the luxurious. Because it was something her father might have said, she laughed to herself. Besides, if Mr. Jorgensen really wanted to buy the foal, he'd call back. The books needed balancing and the feed bill was overdue. She could deal with it later. Right now she wanted a fast ride to nowhere.<br><br>Two of the barn cats circled, then settled back into the hay as she led the roan gelding outside. His breath puffed out in a cloud of mist as she double-checked his cinch. "Let's go, Judd." With the ease of long experience, she swung herself into the saddle and headed south.<br><br>There would be no fast ride here, where the snow and mud had mixed itself into a slushy mire. The air was cold and heavy with damp, but she felt a sense of anticipation. Things were changing, and wasn't that all anyone could ask? They kept to a fast walk, with both of them straining for what always seemed just out of reach. Freedom.<br><br>Perhaps agreeing to be interviewed for this book would bring some portion of it. She could only hope. But the doubts she'd lived with ever since the arrangements had been made still hovered. What was right, what was wrong, what were the consequences? She'd have to assume the responsibility, no matter what occurred.<br><br>She rode over the land she loved yet never quite considered her own.<br><br>The snow was melting in the pasture. In another month, she thought, the foals could play on the new grass. She'd plant hay and oats, and this year&#x2014;maybe this year&#x2014;her books would inch over into the black.<br><br>Chuck would never have worried. He'd never thought about tomorrow, only about the next moment. The next car race. She knew why he'd bought the land in rural Virginia. Perhaps she'd always known. But at the time she'd been able to take his gesture of guilt as a gesture of hope. Her ability to find and hold on to thin threads of hope had gotten her through the last eight years.<br><br>Chuck had bought the land, then had spent only a few scattered weeks on it. He'd been too restless to sit and watch the grass grow. Restless, careless and selfish, that was Chuck. She'd known that before she'd married him. Perhaps that was why she'd married him. She couldn't claim he'd ever pretended to be anything else. It was simply that she'd looked and seen what she'd wanted to see. He'd swept into her life like the comet he was and, blinded with fascination, she'd followed.<br><br>The eighteen-year-old Abigail O'Hurley had been stunned and thrilled at being romanced by the dramatic Chuck Rockwell. His name had been front-page news as he'd raced his way through the Grand Prix circuit. His name had been in bold type on the scandal sheets as he'd raced his way through the hearts of women. The young Abigail hadn't read the tabloids.<br><br>He'd spun her into his life in Miami, charmed and dazzled her. He'd offered excitement. Excitement and a freedom from responsibilities. She'd been married before she'd been able to catch her breath.<br><br>Though a light drizzle was falling now, Abby stopped her horse. She didn't mind the rain that dampened her face and jacket. It added another quality she'd needed that morning. Isolation. A coward's way, she knew, but she'd never thought herself brave. What she had done&#x2014;what she would continue to do&#x2014;was survive.<br><br>The land curved gently, patched with snow, misted with a fog that hovered over it. When Judd pawed the ground impatiently, she patted his neck until he was quiet again. It was so beautiful. She'd been to Monte Carlo, to London and Paris and Bonn, but after nearly five years of day-to-day living and dawn-to-dusk working, she still thought this was the most beautiful sight in the world.<br><br>The rain splattered down, promising to make the dirt roads that crisscrossed her land all but unmanageable. If the temperatures dropped that night, the rain would freeze and leave a slick and dangerous sheen of ice over the snow. But it was beautiful. She owed Chuck for this. And for so much more.<br><br>He'd been her husband. Now she was his widow. Before he'd burned himself out, he'd singed her badly, but he'd left her two of the most important things in her life: her sons.<br><br>It was for them she'd finally agreed to let the writer come. She'd dodged offers from publishers for more than four years. That hadn't stopped an unauthorized biography of Chuck Rockwell or the stories that still appeared from time to time in the papers. After months of soul-searching, Abby had finally come to the conclusion that if she worked with a writer, a good writer, she would have some control over the final product. When it was done, her sons would have something of their father.<br><br>Dylan Crosby was a very good writer. Abby knew that was as much a disadvantage as an advantage. He'd poke into areas she was determined to keep off-limits. She wanted him to. When he did, she'd answer in her way, and she'd finally close that chapter of her life.<br><br>She would have to be clever. With a shake of her head, she clucked to her horse and sent him moving again. The trouble was, she'd never been the clever one. Chantel had been that. Her older sister&#x2014;older by two and a half minutes&#x2014;had always been able to plan and manipulate and make things happen.<br><br>Then there was Maddy, her other sister, younger by two minutes and ten seconds. Maddy was the outgoing one, the one who could usually make her own way through sheer drive and will.<br><br>But she was Abby, the middle triplet. The quiet one. The responsible one. The dependable one. Those titles still made her wince.<br><br>Her problem now wasn't a label that had been pinned on her before she could walk. Her problem now was Dylan Crosby, former investigative reporter turned biographer. In his twenties he'd unearthed a Mafia connection that had eventually crumbled one of the largest mob families on the East Coast. Before he'd turned thirty he'd unhinged the career of a senator with an unreported Swiss bank account and aspirations to higher office. Now she had to handle him.<br><br>And she would. After all, he would be on her turf, under her roof. She would feed him information. The secrets she wanted kept secret were locked in her own head and her own heart. She alone had the key.<br><br>If she'd learned nothing else as the middle daughter of a pair of road-roving entertainers, she'd learned how to act. To get what she wanted, all she had to do was give Dylan Crosby one hell of a show.<br><br><i>Never tell the whole truth, girl. Nobody wants to hear it. </i>That's what her father would have said. And that, Abby told herself with a smile, was what she'd keep reminding herself of over the next few months.<br><br>A bit reluctant to leave the open road and the rain, Abby turned her horse and headed back. It was almost time to begin.<br><br>Dylan cursed the rain and reached out the window again to wipe at the windshield with an already-drenched rag. The wiper on his side was working only in spurts. The one on the other side had quit altogether. Icy rain soaked through his coat sleeve as he held the wheel with one hand and cleared his vision with the other. He'd been mad to buy such an old car, classic or not. The '62 Vette looked like a dream and ran like a nightmare.<br><br>It probably hadn't been too smart to drive down from New York in February, either, but he'd wanted the freedom of having his own car&#x2014;such as it was. At least the snow he'd run into in Delaware had turned to rain as he'd driven south. But he cursed the rain again as it pelted through the open window and down his collar.<br><br>It could be worse, he told himself. He couldn't think of precisely how, but it probably could. After all, he was finally going to sink his teeth into a project he'd been trying to make gel for three years. Apparently Abigail O'Hurley Rockwell had decided she'd squeezed the publisher for all she could get.<br><br>A pretty sharp lady, he figured. She'd snagged one of the hottest and wealthiest race car drivers on the circuit. And she'd hardly been more than a kid. Before she'd reached nineteen she'd been wearing mink and diamonds and rolling dice in places like Monte Carlo. It was never much strain to spend someone else's money. His ex-wife had shown him that in a mercifully brief eighteen-month union.<br><br>Women were, after all, born with guile. They were fashioned to masquerade as helpless, vulnerable creatures. Until they had their hooks in you. To shake free, you had to bleed a little. Then if you were smart, you took a hard look at the scars from time to time to remind yourself how life really worked.<br><br>Dylan struggled with the map beside him, held it in front while steering with his elbows, then swore again. Yes, that had been his turn. He'd just missed it. With a quick glance up and down the stretch of rain-fogged road, he spun into a U-turn. The wipers might be pitiful, but the Vette knew how to move.<br><br>He couldn't imagine the Chuck Rockwell he'd followed and admired choosing to settle in the backwoods of Virginia. Maybe the little woman had talked him into buying it as some sort of hideaway. She'd certainly been hibernating there for the past few years.<br><br>Just what kind of woman was she? In order to write a thorough biography of the man, he had to understand the woman. She'd stuck with Rockwell like glue for nearly the first full year on the circuit, then she'd all but disappeared. Maybe the smell of gas and smoking tires had annoyed her. She hadn't been in the stands for her husband's victories or his defeats. Most importantly, she hadn't been there when he'd run his last race. The one that had killed him. From the information Dylan had, she'd finally shown up at the funeral three days later but had hardly spoken a word. She hadn't shed a tear.<br><br>She'd married a gold mine and turned a blind eye to his infidelities. Money was the only answer. Now, as his widow, she was in the position of never having to lift a finger. Not bad for a former singer who'd never made it past hotel lounges and second-rate clubs.<br><br>He had to slow the Vette to a crawl to make it down the slushy, rut-filled lane marked by a battered mailbox with Rockwell painted on the side.<br><br>Obviously she didn't believe in spending much money on maintenance. Dylan wiped his window again and set his teeth against each jarring bump. When he heard his muffler scrape, he stopped cursing the rain and started cursing Abigail. The way he saw it, she had a closetful of silk and fur but wouldn't shell out for minimal road repair.<br><br>When he saw the house, he perked up a bit. It wasn't the imposing, oppressive plantation house he'd been expecting. It was charming and homey, right down to the rocker on the front porch. The shutters on the windows were painted Colonial blue, providing a nice contrast to the white frame. A deck with a double railing skirted the second floor. Though he could see the house needed a new paint job, it didn't look run-down, just lived-in. There was smoke trailing up from the chimney and a bike with training wheels leaning on its kick-stand under the overhang of the roof. The sound of a dog's deep-throated barking completed the scene.<br><br>He'd often thought of finding a place just like this for himself. A place away from crowds and noise where he could concentrate on writing. It reminded him of the home he'd had as a child, where security had gone hand in hand with hard work.<br><br>When his muffler scraped the road again, he was no longer charmed. Dylan pulled up behind a pickup truck and a compact station wagon and shut off his engine. Dropping his rag on the floor mat, he rolled up his window and had started to open the door when a mass of wet fur leaped on it.<br><br>The dog was enormous. Maybe it had meant to give a friendly greeting, but in its current bedraggled state, the animal didn't look too pleasant. As Dylan gauged its size against that of a small hippo the dog scraped two muddy paws down his window and barked.<br><br>"Sigmund!"<br><br>Both Dylan and the dog looked toward the house, where a woman stood near the porch steps. So this was Abigail, he mused. He'd seen enough pictures of her over the years to recognize her instantly. The fresh-faced ingenue in the pits at Rockwell's races. The stunning socialite in London and Chicago. The cool, composed widow by her husband's grave. Yet she wasn't precisely what he'd expected.<br><br>Her hair, a honey blond, fell across her forehead in wispy bangs and skimmed her shoulders. She looked very slender, and very comfortable in jeans and boots and a bulky sweater that bagged at her hips. Her face was pale and delicate through the rain. He couldn't see the color of her eyes, but he could see her mouth, full and un-painted as she called to the dog again.<br><br>"Sigmund, get down now."<br><br>The dog let out a last halfhearted bark and obeyed. Cautious, Dylan opened the door and stepped out. "Mrs. Rockwell?"<br><br>"Yes. Sorry about the dog. He doesn't bite. Very often."<br><br>"There's good news," Dylan muttered, and popped his trunk.<br><br>As he pulled out his bags, Abby stood where she was while her nerves tightened. He was a stranger, and she was letting him into her home, into her life. Maybe she should stop it now, right now before he'd taken another step.<br><br>Then he turned, bags in hand, and looked at her. Rain streamed from his hair. It was dark, darker now wet and plastered around his face. Not a kind face, she thought immediately as she rubbed her palms on her thighs. There was too much living in it, too much knowledge, for kindness. A woman had to be crazy to let a man like that into her life. Then she saw that his clothes were drenched and his shoes already coated with mud.</p><h2>Rutabaga the Adventure Chef: Book 2: Feasts of Fury</h2><p>On their mission to find only the most exotic ingredients for top-notch dishes, Rutabaga and his pet cooking pot, Pot, somehow manage to get themselves into a series of pickles.

A doctoral student at the University of Kansas, he writes to the estate of the Latin American author Jules Gund, requesting permission to write Gund's authorized biography. His request is refused, but Omar has already accepted a fellowship from the university, and with his girlfriend's vehement encouragement, he goes in person to Uruguay to petition to Gund's three executors. Although Caroline Gund, Jules' wife, and Arden Langdon, Jules' mistress and mother of his child, are initially opposed to the idea of a biography, Omar has the support of Adam, Jules' older brother, and hopes to be able to persuade the two women. Omar's unexpected arrival in Uruguay reverberates through this odd and isolated little family group, and his stay in the languid, dreamy Ochos Rios makes him question his former life in Kansas, and his ability-even his desire-to write an "authorized" life. <br><br>A novel about the random nature of love, and the ways in which we confront or avoid life's choices, <i>The City of Your Final Destination</i> is a touching, clever and wonderfully comic fourth novel from Peter Cameron.<br><br></p><p>Peter Cameron's sublime, beautiful novel <i>City of Your Final Destination</i> concerns true love and a young academic's struggle to break free from a life he's molded but doesn't want to live. Omar Razaghi, who's pursuing a Ph.D. at a Midwestern university, fudges his application for grant money, stating he has already obtained authorization from the family of the deceased minor novelist Jules Gund. When he belatedly seeks permission to proceed, the three executors--Gund's brother, Adam; former wife Caroline; and Arden, Gund's mistress and mother of Gund's daughter, Portia--decline. Prompted by his girlfriend, Deirdre, Omar shows up unexpectedly in Uruguay, seeking to convince the family of his--and their--need for a biography of Jules Gund to exist. <p> Cameron is an able storyteller, and his command allows the prose to flow simply and beautifully; here, most every word counts. Adam's often hilarious wit and Caroline's recalcitrance are sharply drawn, descriptions are in crisp relief, and Cameron gives us many reasons to smile: "Pete stood there for a moment, as if he were deciding, trying to think of a reason why he must stay with them, but he was not clever enough, and so of course he had to leave." <i>The City of Your Final Destination</i> is a refreshing look at the impact of desire and love on quirky, elegantly drawn characters. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p><br><b>Peter Cameron</b> is the author of <i>The Weekend</i> and <i>Andorra</i>.

As he comes to know the children, and sees how they live, Chi Huang is drawn deeper and deeper into their complex and desperate lives. The doctor soon realizes that to truly help these children, he will have to follow the example of Jesus: live among them, love them in spite of their brokenness, and cling to his faith in God's goodness, even when it appears it is nowhere to be found. A true story that will inspire and challenge readers to greater faith and action. The book includes a Foreword by Harvard professor and world-renowned expert on the moral and spiritual development of children, Dr. Robert Coles.</p><p><b>Dr. Chi Huang</b> earned an undergraduate degree in biology from Texas A&amp;M University and graduated cum laude in 1998 from Harvard Medical School. He is an assistant professor in pediatrics, medical director of inpatient pediatrics, director of the pediatric global health initiative, and internal medicine hospitalist attending at Boston Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine. He has spent the last fifteen years advocating for the lives of street children in developing countries; was influential in cofounding Casa Bernabe, a home for Bolivian street children, in 2001; and was the founder of Bolivian Street Children Project, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, in 2002. Dr. Huang has received numerous awards and recognition for his work. He and his wife, Kristin, have three daughters.<i>Starred Review.</i> Do you see our invisible children?" writes Huang, at the conclusion of his touching and sometimes painful book about the street children of La Paz, Bolivia. Huang, the founder of the Bolivian Street Children Project and an attending physician at Boston Medical Center, went to Bolivia to work with homeless children when he was fresh out of Harvard medical school. Looking to fulfill a sense of Christian mission as well as to come to grips with some of his personal history, he committed to spending a year caring for homeless children in an orphanage. His ministry quickly expanded from daytime medical care at the orphanage to nighttime care for the children on the streets of La Paz, and it is these later stories that Huang tells. He gives only enough of his own story to let the reader understand his lens, but it is the children's stories Huang cares about. Told simply and without exaggeration, each child's account speaks for itself, demonstrating the humanity of those who are usually invisible. Always honest about his own anger, frustration, confusion and even his doubts about God at times, Huang inspires readers to reach out, even to just one child, and make a difference in a life. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As one of the few survivors he has spent much of his life studying Nazism and the Holocaust, but always as a discipline requiring the greatest coldness and objectivity, with his personal story set to one side. But he has remained haunted by specific memories and images, thoughts he has been unable to shake off. Translated by Ralph Mandel. &#39;The greatest book on Auschwitz since Primo Levi ... Kulka has achieved the impossible&#39; - the panel of Judges, Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize</p><p>Otto Dov Kulka was born in Czechoslovakia in 1933. He is Professor Emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&#39;A poetic masterpiece unlike anything else written on the subject&#39; -- Simon Schama * Telegraph BOOKS OF THE YEAR * This is one of the most remarkable testimonies to inhumanity that I know. The deeply moving recollections of Dov Kulka&#39;s boyhood years in Auschwitz, interwoven with reflections of elegiac, poetic quality, vividly convey the horror of the death-camp, the trauma of family and friends, and the indelible imprint left on the memory of a young boy who became a distinguished historian of the Holocaust. An extraordinarily important work which needs to be read -- Sir Ian Kershaw Astonishing ... [Landscapes] is, quite simply, extraordinary ... a sort of Modernist precipitate of a historical work, something strange and powerful formed from, but separate to, the solution of history ... I can&#39;t see how this book could be bettered -- Robert Eaglestone * Times Higher Education * Almost unclassifiable ... Nothing else I have read comes close to this profound examination of what the Holocaust means ... [Kulka&#39;s] journey strikes me as a quest similar to the attempt to describe the face of God or the structure of the universe. They are too vast and too mysterious. Not that this stops us, or this author, from trying -- Linda Grant * New Statesman * Primo Levi&#39;s testimony, it is often said, is that of a chemist: clear, cool, precise, distant. So with Kulka&#39;s work: this is the product of a master historian - ironic, probing, present in the past, able to connect the particular with the cosmic. His memory is in the service of deep historical understanding, rendered in evocative prose that is here eloquently translated from Hebrew -- Thomas Laqueur * Guardian * Beautiful, startling ... This is a great book: read it. And be grateful - its publication is, in every possible sense, a miracle ... It is the strange and shocking paradox, this child&#39;s world constructed in such proximity to death, that makes the book so startling and so beautiful. Every incident is, in effect, seen twice: through the eyes of the historian and the eyes of a boy ... This is not history, it is something else... his words enter the wider sphere of literature -- Bryan Appleyard * Sunday Times * Kulka&#39;s reflections have an unsettling rawness ... yet even in Auschwitz, there are moments of protest, black humour and beauty ... This is a grave, poetic and horrifying account of the Holocaust which does not so much revisit the Auschwitz of the past, but the Auschwitz of Kulka&#39;s inner world -- Arifa Akbar * Independent * This is not so much a book about Auschwitz as one about coming to terms with the shock of survival ... Amid fragmentary, digressive impressions are images of terrible poetic concreteness ... What, ultimately, makes Kulka&#39;s book unlike any other first-hand account written about the camps is the authenticity of its vision of an 11-year-old boy... He has done the rest of us - and the world - so great a kindness by writing his book ... offer[ing] the barest glint of sunlight amid a thunderous darkness -- Simon Schama * Financial Times * A book of moments, hauntings and dreams ... it is unremitting and touches us all [with] a hallucinatory power * The Times * Otto Dov Kulka&#39;s brief, beautiful and unsettling Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death brings together childhood memories of Auschwitz with the reflections of a historian who has spent his life working on the Holocaust: a masterly interrogation of memory and the limitations of historical detachment -- Roy Foster * Times Literary Supplement BOOKS OF THE YEAR * For the first time, [Kulka] has turned his academic eye inward to explore as unflinchingly as possible the ways in which his childhood encounter with Auschwitz has affected him. Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death makes for deeply disturbing but ultimately very rewarding reading, and is unlike any Holocaust memoir I have ever come across ... The book is not a memoir in the conventional sense, but an extraordinary collection of some of the memories, ideas and dreams that make up Kulka&#39;s internal landscape -- Keith Lowe * Telegraph * In this short, powerful memoir, every word tells its story * Daily Mail * The term memoir barely seems adequate to the introspective, often poetic, sometimes hallucinatory moments that [Landscapes] captures ... such an important contribution to the literature on the Holocaust ... [it] unsettles presuppositions about the camp and its lasting psychological effects so thoroughly that even a reader steeped in the Holocaust canon is likely to experience a sense of defamiliarisation * Sydney Review of Books *</p><h2>The Joshua Code - 52 Scripture Verses... and The Jesus Code 52 Scripture Questions</h2><p>This book is in great condition.

Desperate for an heir, he proposed a handfasting: a Scottish custom whereby a man can lawfully take a woman into his bed, then, after a year and a day, the couple can either wed or part.

Lynx is a powerful yet cynical knight who is delighted to lay claim to Scotland's Dumfries Castle as commanded by the king. In Dumfries, Lynx enjoys his steward, Jock Leslie, and Leslie's enormous family of 10 children and 31 grandchildren. Lynx, at age 30, is desperate for an heir and proposes that he marry the youngest Leslie daughter, despite that she is a commoner and has no interest in marriage. Lynx believes that the Leslies are so fertile that he is willing to marry beneath himself just for the sake of a child. Jane Leslie, a proud Celtic healer, is a sensitive creature who communes with wild animals and paints lodestones.

Marcus Tanner describes the turbulence and drama of Croatia`s past and -drawing on his own experience and interviews with many of the leading figures in Croatia`s conflict-explains its violent history since Tito`s death in 1980.</p><p>Left in tatters after the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, the new country of Croatia has served as a troubled crossroads between East and West since the Dark Ages. Veteran journalist Marcus Tanner set out to write the recent history of this nation, but found it impossible to cover the 1990s without referring to World War II, and impossible to write about that period without going back even further. So he begins his account in the 7th century, covers Croatian history in a brief but thorough manner, and spends the final third of his book describing how Croatia regained its sovereignty in 1992. A glut of books on the Balkan War give short shrift to this intriguing story. Tanner corrects this problem with a fine and unique contribution.Marcus Tanner was Balkan correspondent of the London Independent from 1988 to 1994 and subsequently the paper&#39;s assistant foreign editor.

But after the events I am about to describe, I studied engineering geology and became a building contractor. Even so, readers shouldn&#x2019;t conclude from my telling the story now that it is over, that I&#x2019;ve put it all behind me. The more I remember, the deeper I fall into it. Perhaps you, too, will follow, lured by the enigma of fathers and sons.<br><br>In 1984, we lived in a small apartment deep in Be&#x15f;ikta&#x15f;, near the nineteenth-�century Ottoman Ihlamur Palace. My father had a little pharmacy called Hayat, meaning &#x201c;Life.&#x201d; Once a week, it stayed open all night, and my father took the late shift. On those evenings, I&#x2019;d bring him his dinner. I liked to spend time there, breathing in the medicinal smells while my father, a tall, slim, handsome figure, had his meal by the cash register. Almost thirty years have passed, but even at forty-�five I still love the smell of those old pharmacies lined with wooden drawers and cupboards.<br><br>The Life Pharmacy wasn&#x2019;t particularly busy. My father would while away the nights with one of those small portable television sets so popular back then. Sometimes his leftist friends would stop by, and I would arrive to find them talking in low tones.

At the first chance, I&#x2019;d take his empty dinner box and walk back home under the plane trees and the pale streetlights. I learned never to tell my mother about seeing Father&#x2019;s leftist friends at the shop. That would only get her angry at the lot of them and worried that my father might be getting into trouble and about to disappear once again.<br><br>But my parents&#x2019; quarrels were not all about politics. They used to go through long periods when they barely said a word to each other. Perhaps they didn&#x2019;t love each other. I suspected that my father was attracted to other women, and that many other women were attracted to him. Sometimes my mother hinted openly at the existence of a mistress, so that even I understood. My parents&#x2019; squabbles were so upsetting that I willed myself not to remember or think about them.<br><br>It was an ordinary autumn evening the last time I brought my father his dinner at the pharmacy. I had just started high school. I found him watching the news on TV. While he ate at the counter, I served a customer who needed aspirin, and another who bought vitamin-�C tablets and antibiotics. I put the money in the old-�fashioned till, whose drawer shut with a pleasant tinkling sound. After he&#x2019;d eaten, on the way out, I took one last glance back at my father; he smiled and waved at me, standing in the doorway.<br><br>He never came home the next morning. My mother told me when I got back from school that afternoon, her eyes still puffy from crying. Had my father been picked up at the pharmacy and taken to the Political Affairs Bureau? They&#x2019;d have tortured him there with bastinado and electric shocks. It wouldn&#x2019;t have been the first time.<br><br>Years ago, soldiers had first come for him the night after the military coup. My mother was devastated. She told me that my father was a hero, that I should be proud of him; and until his release, she took over the night shifts, together with his assistant Macit. Sometimes I&#x2019;d wear Macit&#x2019;s white coat myself&#x2014;�though at the time I was of course planning to be a scientist when I grew up, as my father had wanted, not some pharmacist&#x2019;s assistant.<br><br>When, however, my father again disappeared seven or eight years after that, it was different. Upon his return, after almost two years, my mother seemed not to care that he had been taken away, interrogated, and tortured. She was furious at him. &#x201c;What did he expect?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>So, too, after my father&#x2019;s final disappearance, my mother seemed resigned, made no mention of Macit, or of what was to become of the pharmacy. That&#x2019;s what made me think that my father didn&#x2019;t always disappear for the same reason. But what is this thing we call thinking, anyway?<br><br>By then I&#x2019;d already learned that thoughts sometimes come to us in words, and sometimes in images. There were some thoughts&#x2014;�such as a memory of running under the pouring rain, and how it felt&#x2014;�that I couldn&#x2019;t even begin to put into words . . . Yet their image was clear in my mind. And there were other things that I could describe in words but were otherwise impossible to visualize: black light, my mother&#x2019;s death, infinity.<br><br>Perhaps I was still a child, and so able to dispel unwanted thoughts. But sometimes it was the other way around, and I would find myself with an image or a word that I could not get out of my head.<br><br>My father didn&#x2019;t contact us for a long time. There were moments when I couldn&#x2019;t remember what he looked like. It felt as if the lights had gone out and everything around me had vanished. One night, I walked alone toward the Ihlamur Palace. The Life Pharmacy was bolted shut with a heavy black padlock, as if closed forever. A mist drifted out from the gardens of the palace.<br><br>Sometime later, my mother told me that neither my father&#x2019;s money nor the pharmacy was enough for us to live on. I myself had no expenses other than movie tickets, kebab sandwiches, and comic books. I used to walk to Kabata&#x15f; High School and back. I had friends who trafficked in used comic books for sale or loan. But I didn&#x2019;t want to spend my weekends as they did, waiting patiently for customers in the backstreets and by the back doors of cinemas in Be&#x15f;ikta&#x15f;.<br><br>I spent the summer of 1985 helping out at a bookstore called Deniz on the main shopping street of Be&#x15f;ikta&#x15f;. My job consisted mainly of chasing off would-�be thieves, most of whom were students. Every now and then, Mr. Deniz would drive with me to �a&#x11f;alo&#x11f;lu to replenish his stock. The boss grew fond of me: he noticed how I remembered all the authors&#x2019; and publishers&#x2019; names, and he let me borrow his books to read at home. I read a lot that summer: children&#x2019;s books, Jules Verne&#x2019;s Journey to the Center of the Earth, Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s stories, poetry books, historical novels about the adventures of Ottoman warriors, and a book about dreams. One passage in this latter book would change my life forever.<br><br>When Mr. Deniz&#x2019;s writer friends came by the shop, the boss started introducing me as an aspiring writer. By then I had started harboring this dream and foolishly confessed it to him in an unguarded moment. Under his influence, I soon began to take it seriously.</p><h2>The Great American Broadcast: A Celebration of Radio&#39;s Golden Age</h2><p>In an illustrated book-and-CD package, the film critic from Entertainment Tonight brings to life the golden age of radio, profiling its great actors and characters and offering behind-the-scenes anecdotes. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>A broad and glossy, but thoroughly entertaining tour of old- time radio. Though radio is becoming an increasingly segmented stopgap to fill the silences television cannot reach, there was a time when it was a unifying agent, as powerful a mass-cultural force as perhaps America has ever seen. This period, from the early 1920s to the mid-1950s, truly was the ``golden age'' of radio. Film authority Maltin, a regular on Entertainment Tonight, has a sharp eye for telling details, revealing anecdotes--and is never in such a hurry he can't stop for an amusing digression or aside. While his subject is enormous, he provides enough range and breadth of information to make any reader sound knowledgeable at a cocktail party (although he doesn't discuss the advent of FM radio). Actors, directors, sponsors, musicians, sound effects, and more all get their own tidbit-filled chapters. Radio began as a substitute for telegraphy, a way, most notably, for ships at sea to communicate with shore. But others began tuning in, the price of sets came down, and soon the idea of creating regular programming took hold. Maltin ably captures the excitement and seat-of-the-pants style of early radio, when almost everything was live, leaving little room for mistakes. Though there was enormous room for creativity and innovation, sponsors quickly came to exert substantial influence over the shows aired under their aegis (no mention allowed, for example, of the word ``lucky'' on shows sponsored by a tobacco brand other than Lucky Strikes). After WW II, as television--and its unremitting literalism--became an increasingly serious challenge, live shows were replaced by tape, more stars were trotted out, and audience segmentation increased, but nothing could stem radio's slide from the popular consciousness into background noise. A warm, engaging valentine to a bygone art form and era. (130 b&amp;w photos) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It's not a comprehensive history, just a stroll through every anecdote Maltin could find, from the hilarious to the mundane. -- <i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>Leonard Maltin brings the same seemingly boundless enthusiasm and encyclopedic recall previously devoted to film to the so-called Golden Age of broadcasting....

One part <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i> and one part <i>Why Sinatra Matters</i>, <i>How to Hepburn </i>teases some unexpected lessons from the life of a woman whose freewheeling, pants-wearing determination redefined the image of the independent woman while eventually endearing her to the world. <br>This witty, provocative gem is full of no-nonsense Hepburn-style commentary on subjects such as: making denial work for you; the importance of being brash, facing fear, and always having an aviator in your life; learning why and how to lie; the benefits of discretion; making the most of a dysfunctional relationship; and the power of forgiving your parents.

Her choices were famously unconventional&#x2014;rejecting family life in favor of her career, living as Spencer Tracy's mistress for decades, wearing slacks instead of skirts. Convinced there are lessons here for modern women, journalist and novelist Karbo (<i>Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me</i>) decided to try to figure out how Hepburn made it all work. For instance, while Hepburn rejected marriage, perhaps she got everything she really wanted (love and companionship) without the baggage she didn't want (fights over doing the laundry or cooking dinner). Karbo acknowledges "you don't always have to know what you're getting into in order to succeed"; Hepburn knew that to "go forward blindly" often works just as well. Also, Hepburn found denial worked just fine, allowing her to ignore early criticism that she couldn't act or that she had a terrible voice. Karbo presents all this heterodox advice with great humor, but there's a point she's making to sister Gen-Xers: Hepburn broke all the rules women were supposed to follow and still had a fabulous life. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This time, the focus is on "black men and the women who love them." She provides valuable insight into a self-help approach that men can implement to analyze, explain, and improve their conditions and relationships. She notes in her introduction that she received a vision that inspired and led her to write and speak to and for black men. She expresses her insight in 13 chapters ranging from "A Million Men Marched" to "The Principles of Spiritual Manhood." Vanzant succeeds in probing the many issues that confront black men in this society and challenges them to deal with their situations from a spiritual understanding rather than an intellectual analysis. Although the targeted audience is African American men, the information will be well regarded by African American women. Vanzant's popularity and success in the area of spiritual consciousness will make this volume another valued addition to library and private collections. <i>Lillian Lewis</i></p><h2>The Devil and Daniel Webster (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>A spirited selection from one of the most highly prized American writers of the twentieth century<br><br>Before his premature death in 1943, Stephen Vincent Benet was one of America's most prolific poets, novelists, and short-story writers. He is also, along with Robert Frost, Robert Lowell, and Robert Penn Warren, the only author to receive two Pulitzer prizes for his poetry. Featured in this anthology of his writings is a generous selection of his verse, anchored by his two Pulitzer Prize- winning poems, <i>John Brown's Body</i> and <i>Western Star</i>. Hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as "an American <i>Iliad</i>," <i>John Brown's Body</i> (1929) is an epic chronicle of the Civil War, from the raid on Harper's Ferry to General Lee's surrender at Appomattox. <br><br>Through a versatile array of masterly short stories, Benet explored such subjects as American society, history, politics, and the supernatural. Among the two dozen stories selected for this volume are the haunting title story and the wrenching "A Death in the Country." A final section representing Bent's nonfiction collects several of his penetrating essays on writing and education, including "Most Unforgettable Character I've Known." Sensitively selected and thoughtfully arranged, this vibrant anthology will reintroduce readers to an American master.</p><p>Stephen Vincent Benet (1898-1943), poet, novelist, and short-story writer, was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

I have not tired of the wilderness; rather I enjoy its beauty and the vagrant life I lead, more keenly all the time. I prefer the saddle to the streetcar and star-sprinkled sky to a roof, the obscure and difficult trail, leading into the unknown, to any paved highway, and the deep peace of the wild to the discontent bred by cities. Do you blame me then for staying here, where I feel that I belong and am one with the world around me?&#34; --From Everett&#39;s last letter to his brother Waldo before he disappeared, written November 11, 1934. Everett Ruess developed a profound connection with the arid wilderness of the Southwest. Finding inspiration in this land of harsh beauty, Everett wandered, painted, and wrote; his letters revealed an intelligent and gifted young man who was most at home in desert canyons and rugged mountains. In one of his poems, &#34;The Artist&#39;s Song of Inspiration,&#34; Everett wrote: &#34;Nature has shown me what to strive for, and I shall not be slow to follow her.&#34; Everett did follow Nature, and in November of 1934, at the age of twenty, Everett followed her into the Escalante region of southern Utah and never returned. On Desert Trails with Everett Ruess was teh first collection of Everett&#39;s writings and was originally published in 1940, six years after his disappearance. This commemorative edition once again makes available the writings that made Everett Ruess a wilderness legend.Contents Editor&#39;s Preface to the Commemorative Edition Foreword by Randall Henderson &#34;Son!&#34; by Stella Knight Ruess &#34;Say That I Kept My Dream&#34; by Hugh Lacy Where Everett Ruess Vanished Poems and Letters by Everett Ruess Poems 1929 Poems 1930 Letters 1931 Letter 1932 Letters and Poems 1933 Letters 1934 What Became of Everett Ruess&#34; by Hugh Lacy Appendix Epilogue by W.

In the highly controversial and original <i>Redefining Genocide</i>, Damian Short systematically rethinks how academia currently characterizes genocide and how it actually should define it in the future. Short uses close empirical analysis of several controversial yet underdiscussed case studies worldwide, such as Palestine, Sri Lanka, Australia, and Alberta&#x2019;s Tar Sands. With intense examination of topical issues&#x2014;such as fracking, environmental destruction, and the West Bank settlements&#x2014;he reveals the key roles that settler colonialism, capitalism, finite resources, and the ecological crisis play in driving genocidal social death on a global scale. A provocative rethinking of how one of our world&#x2019;s most disturbing aspects should be defined in the modern age, <i>Redefining Genocide</i> will be essential reading for all students and scholars of genocide studies.</p><p><b>Damian Short</b> is a reader in human rights and director of the Human Rights Consortium and Extreme Energy Initiative at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. He is also Editor in Chief of the International Journal of Human Rights.&#x201c;<i>Redefining Genocide</i> is an incisive, bold, and illuminating exploration of the close links between genocide, colonialism, and ecocide. With flair and insight, it addresses the vulnerability of humanity in the perilous age of the Anthropocene.&#x201d; (<i>John Docker, author of The Origins of Violence: Religion, History and Genocide</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Short should be commended for an engaging, well-supported, and important contribution. Not only should this book be essential reading for genocide scholars, <i>Redefining Genocide</i> should be read across indigenous and environmental studies, criminology, sociology, international development, and political science.&#x201d; (<i>Theoretical Criminology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Redefining Genocide</i> . . . will undoubtedly have a significant impact within the social sciences.&#x201d; (<i>Capitalism Nature Socialism</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Short&#x2019;s discussion of genocide, ecocide and colonialist exploitation is delivered with clarity and intellectual insight. It is both an important reminder of some nearly forgotten histories of inhumanity and a warning about future dangers to the planet.&#x201d; (<i>Nigel South, University of Essex</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An important, path-breaking book. It expands genocide studies into disciplines and concerns that reach far beyond the academy. Policy-makers and activists, as well as scholars troubled by the genocidal potential and local impacts of global developments, must urgently engage with its arguments.&#x201d; (<i>Tony Barta, La Trobe University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;'Makes fascinating, compelling, and theoretically coherent connections between colonialism, genocide, and ecological destruction. The field of genocide studies puts out a number of books each year, but this one truly counts as a required reading that unites a number of fields of study that have remained separate for too long . . . one of the most important works published in the field in recent years.&#x201d; (<i>Academic Council on the United Nations System</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a very welcome and much needed book. In it, Short offers a timely and important challenge for us all to contend with the ongoing and intertwined threats of ecological and group destruction.&#x201d; (<i>Andrew Woolford, author of This Benevolent Experiment: Indigenous Boarding Schools, Genocide and Red</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Genocide scholars have a habit of not getting the bigger picture, they concentrate on the politics, the law, or the human psychology but leaving out the crucial environmental underpinning. If you wreck an environment upon which communities depend, their destruction will inexorably follow. Short is one of the few genocide scholars who does get it and this book is to be vastly welcomed for the belated paradigm shift it augurs.&#x201d; (<i>Mark Levene, author of The Crisis of Genocide</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this important and timely book, the sociologist Damian Short highlights the destruction wrought by the interaction of genocide and ecocide. Well-chosen case studies about Indigenous peoples&#x2019; catastrophic experiences of land appropriation and resource exploitation by state-authorised corporations reveal that the perfectly legal economic processes of settler colonialism manifest a largely ignored banality of evil.&#x201d; (<i>Dirk Moses, author of Empire, Colony, Genocide</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Short poses a fundamental challenge to scholars and citizens alike. He forces us to rethink our entire understanding of the crime of genocide, and more particularly its relationship with the environmental harms which will dominate the century to come. This is interdisciplinary scholarship at its very best, I urge you to read it now.&#x201d; (<i>Tom Lawson, author of The Last Man: A British Genocide in Tasmania</i>)</p><h2>The New Corporate Strategy</h2><p>Corporate Strategy [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Shatter</h2><p><p>In Michael Robotham&#x2019;s latest thriller, psychologist Joe O&#x2019;Loughlin&#x2014;the appealing hero of <i>Suspect</i>&#x2014;tries to prevent a suicide and finds himself locked in a deadly duel with a very clever killer. <br><br>Joe O'Loughlin is on familiar territory&#x2014;standing on a bridge high above a flooded gorge, trying to stop a distraught woman from jumping.

Its Machiavellian Misdeeds!</h2><p>Carefully examine the State Department's past and present track record. When has State done anything resulting in something beneficial for the United States in foreign policy? Or rather, when has State done anything not favoring the global designs of America's dire enemies? Look at the State Department's traitorous machinations with regard to Hungary, Cuba, the Congo, Yugoslavia, Nicaragua, and the rest of the Communist occupied slave labor dictatorships! Look at the State Department's traitorous machinations with regard to South Africa, Taiwan, South Vietnam, Laos, Rhodesia, and other anti-Communist American allies! All were betrayed to the forces of evil by conspirators in the United States government! When was the last time Communist penetration of the State Department was investigated? Both President Dwight D. Eisenhower and President Richard Milhous Nixon promised during their Presidential campaigns to "clean out" the agency! Neither did anything of the sort! Nor did they really intend to! Even during the purported "conservative" Reagan years the arrogant subversives were still untouchable entities! They insolently ran foreign policy contrary to the President's proclaimed goals and contrary to the best interests of America. This is especially appalling when, according to the United States Government Organizational Manual, the State Department's primary objective is supposed to be "to promote the long-range security and well-being of the United States." Some years ago numerous highly placed traitors in the State Department deliberately undermined and brought down the government of Nationalist China! The United States was supposedly helping Nationalist China by sending them hundreds of millions of dollars worth of war goods. The anti-Communist forces desperately needed small arms and ammunition. So entrenched were Communists in the State Department that Chiang got nothing of any value! His supply depots were turned into military junkyards. Ambassador William D. Pawley blamed the tragic loss of China on the subversive machinations of Communist agents and pro-Communists solidly entrenched in the State Department. Included were: Owen Lattimore John Stewart Service Philip Jessup John Paton Davies Jr. John Carter Vincent Dean Acheson O. Edmund Clubb. A few more conspirators devoted to delivering China to the Reds were Communists: Agnes Smedley Frederick Vanderbilt Field Alger Hiss Maxwell Stewart Lauchlin Currie. Ambassador Pawley was asked if the Red takeover of the Chinese mainland could possibly have been the result of "sincere mistakes of judgment." His unequivocal reply: "No, I don't." Reports written by Service, John Carter Vincent, John Paton Davies and many other conspirators never deviated from the Party line. A total of eleven leftist advisors were finally unloaded by Hurley. They included George Acheson, Jr., Raymond P. Ludden, Fulton Freeman, Edward E. Rice, Philip D. Sprouse and Hungerford B. Howard. Hurley was shortly thereafter brought before the Chinese Affairs Board of the State Department. He explained: "I was called on the carpet, with a full array of the pro-Communists of the State Department as my judge and questioners." Ambassador Hurley resigned in November of 1945 after learning that all the traitors he'd fired had been promoted. Most of these subversives were now his bosses! For example, identified Communist John Carter Vincent became a division head! Arthur Ringwalt became acting chief of the China Division! Two other security risks became Ringwalt&#x2019;s assistants. John Paton Davies, identified as a Communist by Hurley was retained as a member of Dean Acheson's policy planning staff!</p><p>Robert W.

Little Mungo is given a picture book starring Captain Galacticus (a dashingly coiffed 1950s-style space hero). The story then follows the adventure contained therein, as Galacticus and his sidekick, Gizmo, run afoul of the mad (to say the least) scientist Dr. Frankenstinker and his army of enormous robot spiders. Just when things come to the thrilling climax, Mungo discovers that the last page has been ripped out. His mother suggests that he make up the rest, and sure enough, Mungo imagines himself transported into the story to help save the day. The boffo illustrations are a fun-filled splash of colorful explosions, busy mechanisms, and caterwauling cartoons, but they might be a bit too aggressive for some children&#x2019;s tastes. Others, especially fans of Mini Grey&#x2019;s Traction Man Is Here! (2005) and Traction Man Meets Turbodog (2008), will revel in the zany twists, mild gross-out humor, and retro-space-age histrionics&nbsp;bursting forth from&nbsp;this flight of fancy.

How could these young men and women kill again and again without remorse? And did the murders go on even after Manson was in jail?

Dollhouses provide a microcosmic view of the world and preserve vanished aspects of daily life and culture. But they also present an idealized version of life, sometimes airbrushing out the more basic and functional elements of everyday living. This new volume uses the dollhouse&#x2019;s contradictions to explore interior design, new technology, professions, and family relationships, con�sidering such topics as the role of the domestic servant and the gendering of spaces and household roles. The V&amp;A Museum of Childhood&#x2019;s collection of dollhouses, representing homes and ways of living spanning three and a half centuries, provides the backdrop for these tales.

Only this time the carcass was the Conner family, and no one was quite dead yet.<br><br>Hap Eastman watched from a corner of the Williamsburg Community Church fellowship hall. He&#x2019;d done his part. Started the coffee, laid out the pastries, set up the chairs. It was something he did every Saturday morning for the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society, and every time it was the same. The old girls started with a list of needs and prayer requests and ended with a fullblown gossip session.<br><br>Hap&#x2019;s wife, Doris, was president, and at forty-five the youngest of the group. So Hap hung around tinkering with fixit jobs in the kitchen or perched on a cold metal folding chair in the corner, a cup of fresh brewed French Roast in one hand and a Louis L&#x2019;Amour novel in the other. Four days a week he was a jurist laden with a heavy workload and weighty decision making. Saturdays were his day to relax.<br><br>Hap had already heard the story from Doris and generally when the birds got going, he tried not to listen. But days like this it was nearly impossible.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what anyone says. We need to talk about it.&#x201d; Geraldine Rivers had the floor, and Hap eyed her suspiciously from a distance. Geraldine was a talker from way back and in charge of the social committee. Generally when the gossip got going, Doris and Geraldine fanned the fires and battled for position. Especially in the heated sessions, and Hap figured this was about as hot as they&#x2019;d ever get.<br><br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t read the minutes yet.&#x201d; Louella tilted her face in Geraldine&#x2019;s direction. The minutes were still tucked in her unopened Bible, so her comment was more for appearances than anything else.<br><br>&#x201c;Minutes mean nothing at a time like this!&#x201d; Geraldine nodded toward Doris. &#x201c;Tell us what you know, will you, Dorie? Several of the ladies here haven&#x2019;t heard what happened.&#x201d;<br><br>The vultures nodded in unison, and Doris took her cue.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s really very tragic, very sundry. I almost hate to talk about it at church.&#x201d; She paused for effect, smoothing the wrinkles in her polyester dress. &#x201c;You all know the Conner family, Angela and her husband, Buddy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s been drinking alcohol at the tavern lately. Louella&#x2019;s husband saw his truck there last week, isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d; Geraldine knew this to be true but enjoyed her own voice too much to be silent for long.<br><br>Doris frowned. &#x201c;Right. He&#x2019;s become a regular drunkard. Now, Angela...well, she&#x2019;s another story. A flirtatious type, not given to things of the Lord.&#x201d; She looked around the circle. &#x201c;Nearly everyone in Williamsburg has suspected her of cheating on Buddy.&#x201d;<br><br>The old birds nodded again.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yesterday I got a call from Betty Jean Stevens...you&#x2019;ve probably noticed she&#x2019;s not here today.&#x201d; Doris&#x2019;s face bunched up like it did when Hap forgot to take out the trash. &#x201c;Seems all those rumors were true. Betty Jean found out last week that her husband&#x2019;s been seeing Angela Conner on the side. And I don&#x2019;t mean at the Piggly Wiggly.&#x201d;<br><br>A collective gasp rose from the circle, and six of the girls started talking at once.<br><br>&#x201c;Bill Stevens and that loose woman?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, that hypocrite!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A deacon at Williamsburg Community has committed adultery?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll need to make a public apology before I forgive him!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew something was happening between those two!&#x201d;<br><br>The cacophony of accusations grew until Geraldine rapped her fist on the table. &#x201c;Quiet, all of you! Quiet!&#x201d;<br><br>They had obviously forgotten about Hap and his novel, and he gazed at them over the top of his book. The biddies fell silent again, and Geraldine lowered her gaze, trying to look appropriately indignant. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more....&#x201d;<br><br>Doris brought her hands together in a neat fold. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She drew a deep breath. &#x201c;For the past few weeks Bill&#x2019;s been...taking a motel room with the Conner woman. Apparently she set about trying to seduce him for some time. And...well...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a temptress in every town!&#x201d; Geraldine obviously intended to maintain her presence even if it was Doris&#x2019;s story.<br><br>&#x201c;Betty Jean says Bill tried to ward off her advances. But last month...he gave in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do declare, Angela Conner&#x2019;s a harlot. She&#x2019;s always been a whore!&#x201d; Geraldine snapped at a lemon pastry and dabbed fiercely at the filling it left on her lips.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I believe she is.&#x201d; Doris looked glad that Geraldine had said it first. Hap sighed. &#x201c;But the worst part happened last night.&#x201d;<br><br>The birds were nodding their interest, waiting breathlessly for the rest of the story.<br><br>Doris sipped her coffee, and Hap knew she was enjoying the way she held her audience captive. &#x201c;Last night...Bill Stevens ran off with her. The two of them. Just like that, they up and left town.&#x201d;<br><br>Several of the women were on their feet firing questions.<br><br>&#x201c;Where did they go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone else know?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris kept her back stiff, her nose in the air. Hap hated it when she got uppity, and this was one of those times. She answered their questions with all the condemnation she could muster.<br><br>&#x201c;D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The capital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Betty Jean says Bill sat her down last night and told her they were through. Told her he&#x2019;s in love with Angela, and they&#x2019;re starting a new life in Washington, D.C.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dear heaven, how&#x2019;s Betty Jean handling it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s ashamed, broken. But she saw it coming. About a year ago, Bill began meeting with Angela to talk about a business venture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Business venture?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess we all know what type business&#x2014;&#x201d; Geraldine spat the word the way boys spit watermelon seeds on a summer day&#x2014;&#x201c;that was, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>Doris hesitated. &#x201c;Betty Jean&#x2019;s just thankful the children are grown and out of the house.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Angela Conner was bad blood from the get-go. Last year, I think she was seeing that attorney in town. You know, the divorce lawyer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right. Everyone this side of Richmond knows the Conner woman and how she was always sniffing around for a man to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Hap raised an eyebrow. A man to bed?<br><br>&#x201c;What about Buddy?&#x201d; Again Geraldine was determined tokeep the discussion alive.<br><br>&#x201c;Buddy&#x2019;s disgraced, as well he should be. Any man who can&#x2019;t keep his wife at home should be ashamed of himself.&#x201d; Doris looked at Geraldine for approval. &#x201c;And I have it on good word that he won&#x2019;t be back to Williamsburg Community Church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I certainly hope not.&#x201d; Geraldine finished the pastry and wadded her napkin into a tight ball of crumbs and sticky paper. &#x201c;The man&#x2019;s a drunkard.&#x201d;<br><br>There were several nods of approval, then one of the vultures gasped. &#x201c;Oh, dear heaven. What&#x2019;s going to happen to little Jade?&#x201d;<br><br><i>Jade.</i> Hap felt his heart sink. He&#x2019;d forgotten about the sweet ten-year-old, Buddy and Angela&#x2019;s only child.<br><br>Geraldine did nothing to hide her righteous indignation. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she the one who pals around with your Tanner?&#x201d;<br><br>A deep crimson fanned across Doris&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;The Conners live in our neighborhood, in Buddy&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s house. Tanner is about the same age as the Conner girl, so it&#x2019;s only natural that the two play together. It doesn&#x2019;t happen often.&#x201d;<br><br>Doris wasn&#x2019;t telling the entire story, and Hap knew why. The reason was an ugly one. He and Dorie had two boys: Harry was twenty and worked for the city dump&#x2014;a detail Dorie never told the girls at the Women&#x2019;s Aid Society. Then there was Tanner. Even at twelve years old, Tanner was everything Harry hadn&#x2019;t been. He was bright and handsome and the finest athlete in primary school. Doris thought he was going to be president of the United States one day. How would it look if he had already made the social mistake of befriending the child of a woman like Angela Conner?<br><br>Of course, there were other reasons Doris detested the children&#x2019;s friendship. More complicated reasons. But Hap didn&#x2019;t want to think about those on a sunny Saturday in May when he was supposed to be relaxing. He shifted positions, but the biddies were too caught up to notice him.</p><h2>Le Ballon Rouge (French edition of &#34;The Red Balloon&#34;</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

A perfunctory genuflection is made to the spiritual life, but the show is the unfreezing of nunly chaste discipline--an ancient (and rather tawdry) popular titillation. Anna, a.k.a Sister Gabriel, is a member of an order where the work is simple and hard, the discipline severe. She is beginning to feel restless, but it's not until her brother commits suicide and her sister-in-law Lynn, mother of two and expecting, calls for help that Anna is exposed to the temptations and challenges of the outside world. Anna helps the distraught Lynn while guiltily enjoying delights like perfumed baths and coffee (the sisters were served hot water--rarely tea). But then she confronts the problem of the family mill (she's the only descendant). The mill, thanks to Anna's brother's instability and the dirty work of a manager, is about to go under. But with an acumen hitherto slumbering at the convent, Anna takes hold, and using her remembered knowledge of the business and materials--from fleece to dye to looms--she routs the bad guy, makes super bank deals, and even, along the way, helps deliver Lynn's baby (with the help of one of the bankers). Un- habited, there'll be a night of love, stolen kisses, and a promise of future partnership before Anna officially leaves the convent. Bernstein (Nuns, 1976) has chosen convent rituals and rules of unusual rigor to point up pulse pounding when the world booms in. It all boils down to: nun thaws, has--whimperin' wimples!--sex and career. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Anna, enclosed for 13 years as Sister Gabriel in a Welsh convent, has already begun to lose her fervor when a crisis summons her briefly outside its walls. Her brother Simon, having brought the family woolen mill to the verge of bankruptcy, has committed suicide and left his pregnant wife Lynn with two small sons. Anna knows the business: she contributes to her convent's income by carding and spinning yarns that she dyes with natural colors from nuts and mosses. Lynn's ineptitude and the mill's imminent ruin impel Anna to try to save the family. At the plant she confronts the scurrilous Beattie, a manager who harrasses female workers and plans to switch to cheaper synthetic fibers, and becomes attracted to an honest overseer, brash Peter Hallam. Submitting rather passively to badgering by her whiny sister-in-law and rough-mannered lover, Anna doesn't always seem forceful enough to make the tough decisions required as she is torn between religious and secular life. Journalist Bernstein, author of three previous novels and The Nuns , a well-researched nonfiction study, does better with depictions of the solaces, rigors, self-flagellations and lesbian temptations of the cloister than with the humdrum workaday details of the yarn-spinning industry.

As he crushes coal and wipes tables, he nurses a dream of escape. His big chance comes when a rich landlord hires him as a chauffeur for his son, daughter-in-law, and their two Pomeranian dogs. From behind the wheels of a Honda, Balram sees Delhi and begins to see how the Tiger might escape his cage. For surely any successful man must spill a little blood on his way to the top? The White Tiger is a tale of two Indias. Balram&#39;s journey from the darkness of village life to the light of entrepreneurial success is utterly amoral, brilliantly irreverent, deeply endearing and altogether unforgettable.</p><p>Aravind Adiga was born in Chennai in 1974.

Not that I have anything against great men. In my way, sir, I consider myself one of your kind. But whenever I see our prime minister and his distinguished sidekicks drive to the airport in black cars and get out and do <i>namastes</i> before you in front of a TV camera and tell you about how moral and saintly India is, I have to say that thing in English. </p><p> Now, you <i>are</i> visiting us this week, Your Excellency, aren't you? All India Radio is usually reliable in these matters. </p><p> That was a joke, sir. </p><p> Ha! </p><p> That's why I want to ask you directly if you really are coming to Bangalore. Because if you are, I have something important to tell you. See, the lady on the radio said, "Mr. Jiabao is on a mission: he wants to know the truth about Bangalore." </p><p> My blood froze. If anyone knows the truth about Bangalore, it's <i>me</i>. </p><p> Next, the lady announcer said, "Mr. Jiabao wants to meet some Indian entrepreneurs and hear the story of their success from their own lips." </p><p> She explained a little. Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except that you don't have entrepreneurs. And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality, <i>does</i> have entrepreneurs. Thousands and thousands of them. Especially in the field of technology. And these entrepreneurs -- <i>we</i> entrepreneurs -- have set up all these outsourcing companies that virtually run America now. </p><p> You hope to learn how to make a few Chinese entrepreneurs, that's why you're visiting. That made me feel good. But then it hit me that in keeping with international protocol, the prime minister and foreign minister of my country will meet you at the airport with garlands, small take-home sandalwood statues of Gandhi, and a booklet full of information about India's past, present, and future. </p><p> That's when I <i>had</i> to say that thing in English, sir. Out loud. </p><p> That was at 11:37 p.m. Five minutes ago. </p><p> I don't just swear and curse. I'm a man of action and change. I decided right there and then to start dictating a letter to you. To begin with, let me tell you of my great admiration for the ancient nation of China. </p><p> I read about your history in a book, <i>Exciting Tales of the Exotic East</i>, that I found on the pavement, back in the days when I was trying to get some enlightenment by going through the Sunday secondhand book market in Old Delhi. This book was mostly about pirates and gold in Hong Kong, but it did have some useful background information too: it said that you Chinese are great lovers of freedom and individual liberty. The British tried to make you their servants, but you never let them do it. I admire that, Mr. Premier. </p><p> I was a servant once, you see. </p><p> Only three nations have never let themselves be ruled by foreigners: China, Afghanistan, and Abyssinia. These are the only three nations I admire. </p><p> Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master, the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I offer to tell you, free of charge, the truth about Bangalore. </p><p> By telling you my life's story. </p><p> See, when you come to Bangalore, and stop at a traffic light, some boy will run up to your car and knock on your window, while holding up a bootlegged copy of an American business book, wrapped carefully in cellophane and with a title like: </p><p> <b>TEN SECRETS OF BUSINESS SUCCESS!</b> </p><p> or </p><p> <b>BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR IN SEVEN EASY DAYS!</b> </p><p> Don't waste your money on those American books. They're so <i>yesterday</i>. </p><p> I am tomorrow. </p><p> In terms of formal education, I may be somewhat lacking. I never finished school, to put it bluntly. Who cares! I haven't read many books, but I've read all the ones that count. I know by heart the works of the four greatest poets of all time -- Rumi, Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, and a fourth fellow whose name I forget. I am a self-taught entrepreneur. </p><p> That's the best kind there is, trust me. </p><p> When you have heard the story of how I got to Bangalore and became one of its most successful (though probably least known) businessmen, you will know everything there is to know about how entrepreneurship is born, nurtured, and developed in this, the glorious twenty-first century of man. </p><p> The century, more specifically, of the <i>yellow</i> and the <i>brown</i> man. </p><p> You and me. </p><p> It is a little before midnight now, Mr. Jiabao. A good time for me to talk. </p><p> I stay up the whole night, Your Excellency. And there's no one else in this 150-square-foot office of mine. Just me and a chandelier above me, although the chandelier has a personality of its own. It's a huge thing, full of small diamond-shaped glass pieces, just like the ones they used to show in the films of the 1970s. Though it's cool enough at night in Bangalore, I've put a midget fan -- five cobwebby blades -- right above the chandelier. See, when it turns, the small blades chop up the chandelier's light and fling it across the room. Just like the strobe light at the best discos in Bangalore. </p><p> This is the only 150-square-foot space in Bangalore with its own chandelier! But it's still a hole in the wall, and I sit here the whole night. </p><p> The entrepreneur's curse. He has to watch his business all the time. </p><p> Now I'm going to turn the midget fan on, so that the chandelier's light spins around the room. </p><p> I am relaxed, sir. As I hope you are. </p><p> Let us begin. </p><p> Before we do that, sir, the phrase in English that I learned from my ex-employer the late Mr. Ashok's ex-wife Pinky Madam is: </p><p> <i>What a fucking joke</i>. </p><p> <b> -- -- -- </b> </p><p> Now, I no longer watch Hindi films -- on principle -- but back in the days when I used to, just before the movie got started, either the number 786 would flash against the black screen -- the Muslims think this is a magic number that represents their god -- or else you would see the picture of a woman in a white sari with gold sovereigns dripping down to her feet, which is the goddess Lakshmi, of the Hindus. </p><p> It is an ancient and venerated custom of people in my country to start a story by praying to a Higher Power. </p><p> I guess, Your Excellency, that I too should start off by kissing some god's arse. </p><p> <i>Which</i> god's arse, though? There are so many choices. </p><p> See, the Muslims have one god. </p><p> The Christians have three gods. </p><p> And we Hindus have 36,000,000 gods. </p><p> Making a grand total of 36,000,004 divine arses for me to choose from. </p><p> Now, there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist. Some believe that <i>none</i> of them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work -- much like our politicians -- and yet keep winning reelection to their golden thrones in heaven, year after year. That's not to say that I don't respect them, Mr. Premier! Don't you ever let that blasphemous idea into your yellow skull. My country is the kind where it pays to play it both ways: the Indian entrepreneur has to be straight and crooked, mocking and believing, sly and sincere, at the same time. </p><p> So: I'm closing my eyes, folding my hands in a reverent <i>namaste</i>, and praying to the gods to shine light on my dark story. </p><p> Bear with me, Mr. Jiabao. This could take a while. </p><p> How quickly do you think you could kiss 36,000,004 arses? </p><p> <b> -- -- -- </b> </p><p> Done. </p><p> My eyes are open again. </p><p> 11:52 p.m. -- and it really is time to start. </p><p> A statutory warning -- as they say on cigarette packs -- before we begin. </p><p> One day, as I was driving my ex-employers Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam in their Honda City car, Mr. Ashok put a hand on my shoulder, and said, "Pull over to the side." Following this command, he leaned forward so close that I could smell his aftershave -- it was a delicious, fruitlike smell that day -- and said, politely as ever, "Balram, I have a few questions to ask you, all right?" </p><p> "Yes, sir," I said. </p><p> "Balram," Mr. Ashok asked, "how many planets are there in the sky?" </p><p> I gave the answer as best as I could. </p><p> "Balram, who was the first prime minister of India?" </p><p> And then: "Balram, what is the difference between a Hindu and a Muslim?" </p><p> And then: "What is the name of our continent?" </p><p> Mr. Ashok leaned back and asked Pinky Madam, "Did you hear his answers?" </p><p> "Was he joking?" she asked, and my heart beat faster, as it did every time she said something. </p><p> "No. That's <i>really</i> what he thinks the correct answers are." </p><p> She giggled when she heard this: but <i>his</i> face, which I saw reflected in my rearview mirror, was serious. </p><p> "The thing is, he probably has...what, two, three years of schooling in him? He can read and write, but he doesn't get what he's read. He's half-baked. The country is full of people like him, I'll tell yo...</p></p><h2>My Year</h2><p>A posthumous publication of the celebrated English writer&#39;s journal chronicles a year of observing and reflecting on nature.</p><p>Roald Dahl (Author) The son of Norwegian parents, Roald Dahl was born in Wales in 1916 and educated at Repton. He was a fighter pilot for the RAF during World War Two, and it was while writing about his experiences during this time that he started his career as an author. His fabulously popular children&#39;s books are read by children all over the world. He died in November 1990.Quentin Blake (Illustrator) Quentin Blake has been drawing ever since he can remember. He taught illustration for over twenty years at the Royal College of Art, of which he is an honorary professor. He has won many prizes, including the Hans Christian Andersen Award for Illustration, the Eleanor Farjeon Award and the Kate Greenaway Medal, and in 1999 he was appointed the first Children&#39;s Laureate. In the 2013 New Year&#39;s Honours List he was knighted for services to illustration.Grade 4 Up-The author's personal reminiscences of boyhood exploits, interwoven with adult observations on various natural phenomena of the English countryside. Each short chapter covers one month, and addresses some peculiarity of one or more species of plant or animal (magpie, mole, mosquito, saffron, cuckoo, foxglove, etc.). Written in his 74th year, these recollections speak to children in the comfortable, but sometimes preachy, manner of an elderly man addressing his grandchildren. Many of the trees and animals he mentions are more abundant in Europe or called by a different name there (i.e., horse chestnuts are called conkers), while some are indigenous only to small sections of the U.S. or are variants of the species found here and will be unfamiliar to American readers. Differences in the British school year add a bit of confusion, as well. Dahl recalls escapades (riding his illicit motorbike past his prep school each Sunday during his final summer term) as well as useful gardening tips (burying wine bottles with only the necks sticking up to scare away moles). Blake has lovingly highlighted the pages of this slim volume with many soft, sketchy watercolor cartoons. Devotees of Dahl's Boy (1984) and Going Solo (1986, both Farrar) will surely request this one, as well.<br><i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ice Cold Case (The Hardy Boys #148)</h2><p>Ice fishing at Pineview Lake, the Hardys learn about a string of local burglaries and vow to break it up, only to soon find themselves in the line of fire.

Beginning with an overall history, the authors set out "to draw attention to objects decorated with, and constructed from, the tiny glass 'seed' beads that are so often overlooked." Maps help to show the trade routes between bead-manufacturing centers, and the authors describe the various processes of making beads worldwide. Five chapters follow--Africa, the Americas, Asia, Oceania and the Arabian Gulf, and Europe-- each detailing and illustrating the different styles used and the history of beadwork in those regions. But the authors' last chapter, "Construction and Techniques," examines the mechanical design of the different styles and how artists and students can identify the workmanship behind the beauty. Here readers learn the differences between the similar techniques <i>tambour</i> and <i>ari, </i>one found commonly in Western beadwork and the other in the Indian subcontinent. Also included is a helpful chapter on collecting beadwork and a list of public collections all over the world. With more than 200 pages of striking color photos, this concise introduction to the history and different forms of beadwork will guide anyone who wants to learn more about the varied art form. <i>Michelle Kaske</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The secret, she says, is learning to create constant "fun" in wedlock. By contrast, traditional preoccupations-with commitment, say, or with being a good wife-are the surest way to douse marital flames. "Commitment means absolutely nothing without fun," she reasons, and the "Good Wife Syndrome" is an "insidious poison that seeps into many relationships" when a woman shelves her desires and happiness to serve her husband. "The world exists to serve you, to celebrate you, to fulfill you," she declares. A partner, therefore, should be a trained pamperer and an accessory to pleasure-in short, a "best friend that you have sex with." Mama Gena hits on a golden truism when she prescribes that women (or anyone really) must cultivate happiness in the rest of their lives and let it radiate into love relationships. She takes this idea to a hedonistic extreme, though, when she encourages followers to discover their sensuality-even through extra-marital affairs if necessary. Based on her own "research" as wife and mother, and peppered with anecdotes from other Sister Goddesses, her gospel of self only occasionally breaks from its solipsistic celebration to remind readers to "take a moment...and notice how they the husbands are feeling." Otherwise, men take a back seat, for better or for worse, in Mama Gena&#x2019;s irreverent guide to marital bliss.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fearfully he approached the designated 8Greeke house for a 6 p.m. dinner where he would give a fifteen-minute introductory talk followed by questions from the men. His fears were magnified because it was a scholarship hall=really brainy students. Further, it was a Jewish scholarship hall! He later described his prayer that day as he walked to the door of the fraternity house:</p><p> "Lord, you know I always stub my toe when I try to explain Christian basics clearly to people with questions. Why must I begin in a residence reserved for the smartest students? They'll tear me apart limb from limb. I'll not live the night out!"</p><p> To his amazement, one young man had his life turned around that night by the new thought that God offered him a brand-new life and power to live it. He decided to become a Christian.</p><p> Encouraged by the good response from this one man, Paul continued. He traveled from campus to campus, leading dorm and fraternity sessions and tirelessly spending hours talking one-on-one with students. From hundreds of campuses on five continents he sought to capture the attention of the bored, the intellectual, the athletic. He used clipped questions to jog the thinking and help the listeners examine their present worldviews, ranging from scientific determinism to placid relativism. He sprinkled in a few "sure-fire" jokes and other good humor. He'd even say, "You exercised blind faith if you ate in a restaurant today." "Believing something doesn't make it true; refusing to believe it doesn't make it false." "Many people who say they don't believe the Bible have actually never read it."</p><p> In twenty-five years of lecturing, Paul found that regardless of the group there were twelve commonly asked questions. "They are predictable," he said. "If we think through the answers to the common questions we hear, we'll know the answers to the right ones. Right answers to the wrong questions aren't of much help!" From his own study of the Bible and research of biblical scholars, he framed his answers. That's how Know Why You Believe was born.</p><p> The message of this newly edited book is entirely Paul's. I have added some exciting new illustrations from the specialized fields of archaeology and science. In each area, I have followed the capsulized biblical basics, which are Paul's intentional focus. The Bible has been shown to be stalwart and trustworthy in the light of any challenge. As Paul said, "No one will think up a question that will bring Christianity crashing even after 2,000 years."</p><p> It has been twenty-four years since the day when the dread news came of Paul's death in an automobile accident. I am awed that God has continued to use these answers. Paul would say, "These are God's thoughts; the light comes from Him." The many stories I continue to hear of God using these words affirm the extraordinary impact of God's truth, which we all seek. </p><p> Just recently I gave a copy of this book to a searching young Sikh woman. After she and her husband visited with me several times in my living room she told me, "This book answered all my questions." She became a fully devoted follower of Jesus Christ=additionally, a sterling wife and mother. Amazing grace. </p><p>&nbsp; </p> Marie Little<p></p> Mt. Prospect, Illinois<p></p></p><p>Until his death, Paul Little traveled widely to speak to thousands, especially to college students. He was on the staff of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and was Associate Professor of Evangelism at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois.This thin primer has become a "classic" of contemporary evangelical Protestantism. Little was a popular evangelist on college campuses before his death in 1975. This book was read widely in the 1970s and now has been revised by his wife and republished. There is a stilted character to the reading. The choppiness may be due in part to the way the text was written, but McKeever still sounds like he's reading a manual. While his voice is clear, it's not as rich as a professional actor's. He generally sounds like an older fundamentalist minister giving a theology lesson.

For nearly 40 years, Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach ran the show, trademark cigar in hand, for the emerald-clad Boston Celtics. Serving as coach from 1950 to 1966, then as general manager and unopposed despot until 1990 or so (he is still on the payroll as a consultant), Red guided the Hub's beloved Jolly Green Giants to 16 NBA championships, including an amazing streak of titles running from 195966. So successful was the team that Auerbach's effective coaching and astute talent assessment--he acquired many of the game's greatest players, including Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, John Havlicek, and Larry Bird (who wrote the book's foreword)--were dismissed by foes as ``The Celtics Mystique.'' During Red's time at the top, the NBA grew from a barnstorming curiosity to a multi- billion-dollar global enterprise, and it would be hard to overstate his influence on the game--but Shaughnessy (The Curse of the Bambino, 1990) very nearly succeeds. While he does show Auerbach's cantankerous and occasionally pig-headed side, the author essentially presents to readers little more than a mash note loaded with anecdotes about Red's cigar-chompin', ref-baitin', hell- drivin' virtuosity. Not merely a great x's and o's guy (the NBA annually presents the Red Auerbach award to its outstanding coach), he is in Shaughnessy's presentation basketball's Moses, the man who led the game out of darkness. Non-Celtics fans might want to skim many passages to get to the parts where Red sagely catalogues the game's changes--for example, his observation that ballplayers ``used to come to practice with gym bags; now they come with attach&#x201a; cases.'' At 77, Red has slowed a bit: He's no longer the preeminent judge of talent, and he's down to two or three stogies a day. But as long as guys like Shaughnessy can hold a pen, it's always Red's game; anyone else just came to play. (8 pages photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now in his late seventies, Auerbach remains the team president of the Boston Celtics, who won 11 titles in 13 years during one stretch in the 1950s and 1960s. Auerbach's signature was all over those teams: he coached the Celtics to nine titles and was the general manager for the rest. Among the stars he acquired and nurtured over the years are Bill Russell (perhaps the best player ever), Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parrish. Along the way, Auerbach has also alienated his peers with his successes and his arrogance. Shaughnessy, a columnist for the <i>Boston Globe</i>, explores Auerbach's career, warts and all. He supplies quotes and anecdotes from Auerbach's friends, foes, and neutral observers. The consensus: Red is loyal but sometimes unforgiving; he's honest but not above tilting the wheel his way; he's a basketball genius but damn lucky, too. He's everything you'd expect in a living legend, and Shaughnessy certainly does him justice. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>Jeppesen: Avionics Fundamentals (2007 Edition)</h2><p>Avionics Fundamentals was developed by the maintenance training staff of United Airlines for use as a training course for airline maintenance personnel.

It reviews his life and work, and sets out to show, through an analysis of key works, how his technique and working methods developed over 50 years. During his long career, Bonnard&#39;s subject matter remained focused on his wife, his homes and his self-portraits, but his approach to these subjects changed radically. At first he worked chiefly in tone, but gradually colour enriched his work, and finally light suffused it. The author argues that Bonnard was not a sentimental survivor of Impressionism, as he was often labelled, but a highly demanding formal artist who transformed light into an emotional atmosphere enveloping the surface within which objects exist.</p><p></p><h2>Mothmeister: Weird and Wonderful Post-Mortem Fairy Tales</h2><p><br>�A stunning, surreal collections of works, celebrating Mothmeister, a taxidermy-obsessed artistic duo<br><br>�Mothmeister boasts over 130,000 followers on Instagram and has participated in several international exhibitions<br><br>�Countless eccentric portraits, as well as a unique glimpse behind the mask <br><br>Artistic duo Mothmeister have created a place they call "Wounderland". It is a land in which grotesque creatures, in fascinating yet disturbing masks, stare out from barren wastelands, usually accompanied by mounted and stuffed animals. Unconventional and enchanting, the fairytale world of Mothmeister is at once reminiscent of a bygone age, while subtly criticising today's ever-present 'selfie' culture, and the beauty standards imposed by the media. <br><br>Superlative and unique, the works of Mothmeister are celebrated and revered in this stunning book.</p><p>Mothmeister is the ever-changing alter ego of two artistic soulmates and passionate taxidermy enthusiasts.</p><h2>Colonial Classics: Woodworking Projects from the Original 13 Colonies</h2><p>Provides diagrams and instructions for making colonial-style towel racks, salt boxes, stools, shaving mirrors, spice cabinets, crock stands, pie safes, tables, and wash stands</p><p></p><h2>A Beautiful Mind: A Biography of John Forbes Nash, Jr., Winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, 1994</h2><p>In this powerful and dramatic biography Sylvia Nasar vividly re-creates the life of a mathematical genius whose career was cut short by schizophrenia and who, after three decades of devastating mental illness, miraculously recovered and was honored with a Nobel Prize. <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> traces the meteoric rise of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a prodigy and legend by the age of thirty, who dazzled the mathematical world by solving a series of deep problems deemed "impossible" by other mathematicians.<p>But at the height of his fame, Nash suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown and began a harrowing descent into insanity, resigning his post at MIT, slipping into a series of bizarre delusions, and eventually becoming a dreamy, ghostlike figure at Princeton, scrawling numerological messages on blackboards. He was all but forgotten by the outside world -- until, remarkably, he emerged from his madness to win world acclaim. A feat of biographical writing, <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> is also a fascinating look at the extraordinary and fragile nature of genius.</p></p><p>Stories of famously eccentric Princetonians abound--such as that of chemist Hubert Alyea, the model for <i>The Absent-Minded Professor</i>, or Ralph Nader, said to have had his own key to the library as an undergraduate. Or the "Phantom of Fine Hall," a figure many students had seen shuffling around the corridors of the math and physics building wearing purple sneakers and writing numerology treatises on the blackboards. The Phantom was John Nash, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his generation, who had spiraled into schizophrenia in the 1950s. His most important work had been in game theory, which by the 1980s was underpinning a large part of economics. When the Nobel Prize committee began debating a prize for game theory, Nash's name inevitably came up--only to be dismissed, since the prize clearly could not go to a madman. But in 1994 Nash, in remission from schizophrenia, shared the Nobel Prize in economics for work done some 45 years previously.<p>Economist and journalist Sylvia Nasar has written a biography of Nash that looks at all sides of his life. She gives an intelligent, understandable exposition of his mathematical ideas and a picture of schizophrenia that is evocative but decidedly unromantic. Her story of the machinations behind Nash's Nobel is fascinating and one of very few such accounts available in print (the CIA could learn a thing or two from the Nobel committees). This highly recommended book is indeed "a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three acts: genius, madness, reawakening." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><b>Sylvia Nasar</b> is the author of the bestselling <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for biography.

A work of creative nonfiction, the book roams through space, time and possibility, mapping cities of sound, melancholia and the afterlife, where time runs backwards or which float among the clouds. In doing so, Imaginary Cities seeks to move beyond the cliches of psychogeography and hauntology, to not simply revisit the urban past, or our relationship with it, but to invade and reinvent it. Following in the lineage of Borges, Calvino, Chris Marker and Kenneth White, the book examines the city from global macrocosm to the microcosm of its inhabitants&#39; perspectives. It proceeds through opium dreams, sea voyages, the hallucinations of prisoners, nocturnal decadence, impossible Soviet skyscrapers, marauding golems, subterranean civilisations, apocalyptic prophecies and the work of architectural visionaries such as Antonio Sant&#39;Elia, Archigram and Buckminster Fuller. It rethinks the ideas of utopias and dystopias, urban exploration, alienation and resistance.It claims that the Situationists lacked ambition when they suggested, &#34;Beneath the paving stones, the beach. &#34; Instead, beneath the paving stones, we may just be able to discern the entire universe. Imaginary Cities demonstrates that each city dreamt up by artists, writers, architects and lunatics has a real-life equivalent and that the great Marco Polo was no liar. Imaginary Cities need not simply exist in fiction or the mind. We already inhabit them.</p><p>Darran Anderson is a writer from Derry.

Sitting through hundreds of hours of interviews and private conversations&#x2014;not only with Jayne but also with her husbands, her lovers, and her children&#x2014;gave Ray the opportunity to present a revealing portrait of the woman. He records her drive for fame and success and her overpowering need to be loved and to love, needs that led her into numerous affairs with rich and powerful men&#x2014;including President John F.

And he discusses frankly Jayne&#x2019;s ultimately successful plan to become pregnant by Nelson Sardelli because she wanted to have an Italian child.<br> <br> Known to millions as the consummate sex symbol who rivaled Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield received more press coverage than anyone else in Hollywood. The headlines were often sensational, causing society matrons and Baptist ministers to shake their heads and point their fingers. But under those sensational headlines there was a woman of greater complexity than any reporter could hope to understand. Strait goes below the surface to examine Jayne's emotions and motivations, revealing the truth about her many lovers, her three unsuccessful marriages, her love affair with Mickey Hargitay that lasted to the end and her battle against and her surrender to alcohol and drugs.</p><p></p><h2>Remember the Lilies</h2><p><p><strong>How will two very different people find love&#x2014;and survive the impossible circumstances of war?</strong></p><p>In 1941 Rand Sterling was a wealthy, womanizing club owner and an American of note among ex-pats and locals alike.

Smart, pretty, ambitious, full of dreams. Blond with a ponytail.<br><br> Sure, Betty&#x2019;s not the most popular girl in school (that&#x2019;s her middle school best friend Veronica) and she doesn&#x2019;t have this high school thing completely figured out (particularly her crush on a certain Archie Andrews). But this girl is genuine and kind and pretty darn funny. She&#x2019;s everything you&#x2019;d expect, and yet still feels like a real live person.<br><br> A youth-oriented novel with simple and fun illustrations by artist Bill Galvan, DIARY OF A GIRL NEXT DOOR: BETTY&nbsp;is the first in a series of prose titles aimed at the tween market who, if I had to guess, may not give comics a second look. Designed to stand tall next to Disney Channel programming and young adult novels,&nbsp;<i>Betty&nbsp;</i>surpasses its peers in quality and depth, delivering a book that not only would appeal to kids (maybe not even just girls) 10 to 14, but can be enjoyed by adults as well (that&#x2019;s me!).<br> Author Tania del Rio provides a beautiful, first-person narration of Betty Cooper&#x2019;s first two months of high school in classic &#x201c;Dear Diary&#x201d; style, but still manages to engage the reader thoroughly from entry to entry. Each passage is treated like its own story, featuring Betty&#x2019;s interactions with best friend Veronica, the dreaded Glossies (Veronica&#x2019;s new ultra cool friends), her next door neighbor Jughead, her parents, and of course, best guy in the world and dream boat extraordinaire &#x2014;&nbsp;Archie.<br> The feelings we get from Betty aren&#x2019;t trite or overplayed, and they&#x2019;re somewhat self-conscious without resorting to being maudlin. Del Rio rides the line very carefully by infusing a wonderful humor in Betty&#x2019;s thoughts and speech, as well as a good sense of how she&#x2019;s learning from herself from start to finish. As this is but a brief swatch of young Betty&#x2019;s life, we don&#x2019;t get a radical growth into womanhood, but the confidence she has by the end of the book finally catches up with her ambitions. It&#x2019;s heartwarming, quite honestly.<br><br> Galvan&#x2019;s doodle-style drawings, meant to mimic Betty&#x2019;s own illustrations (why doesn&#x2019;t she ever consider becoming an artist? Huh.), are really so adorable, it&#x2019;s hard not to grin from ear to ear when you page through the book. The ones gracing the cover and outside spine, in particular &#x2014;&nbsp;Betty herself with a word balloon saying &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me!&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;make me smile every time I open the book.<br><br> As much as I love what Archie Comics has done here, and as much as I am looking forward to the inevitable follow-up starring Veronica, I have a confession to make. I&#x2019;m not keeping my copy. No, I have to ship it immediately to my niece, because if there&#x2019;s anyone in the world who&#x2019;s going to like it more than me, it&#x2019;s someone Betty&#x2019;s own age (or younger even).<br><br> Buy this book for your little middle-school girl. She&#x2019;ll feel like she&#x2019;s getting a peek into the wild sophisticated future of high school, and you can be assured that what she&#x2019;s really getting is the most genuine experience of a good kid who has a great heart that I&#x2019;ve seen in a long time.

The subject and Schultz's lucid prose make this a great addition to any Civil War library."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p> March 5, 1864, was the day on which the Civil War changed to what the <em>Richmond Examiner</em> called "a war of extermination, of indiscriminate slaughter and plunder." It changed because of a few sheets of paper found on a muddy trail outside Richmond. Their legacy was a new and terrible style of warfare. In a daring but failed cavalry raid to free thousands of Union prisoners, the Union commander-twenty-one-year-old Ulric Dahlgren-was killed; on his body were found orders purportedly instructing his men to find and execute Jefferson Davis and the rest of the Confederate cabinet. There was an immediate outpouring of horrified, indignant rage throughout the South, and after the Union disclaimed any knowledge of the papers or the order they contained, Jefferson Davis authorized the use of terrorism against civilians in the North in the form of guerrilla raids, bank robberies, arson, and sabotage. This compelling narrative is the first full-length analysis of the link between Dahlgren's failed raid and the Confederate campaign of terror. "[A] wonderfully vivid portrait of Confederate attempts to stir up rebellion in the North during the war's waning days. . . . Schultz handles all of this melodramatic material with vigor and clarity, a first-rate addition to the bulging shelves of Civil War Studies."-<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> 10 pages of illustrations</p><p>Author Duane Schultz offers a fascinating chronicle of Civil War espionage in this account of the infamous Dahlgren raid, a bold attempt by a small detachment of Union cavalry to free prisoners of war held by the Confederates in Richmond. The effort failed, but its consequences were enormous; allegedly found among slain commander Ulric Dahlgren's papers was an order to assassinate Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Schultz argues persuasively that the papers were a forgery, but whatever the truth, they started a controversy that encouraged Davis to order secret agents based in Canada to launch a campaign of terror on the Northern home front. He describes a few stunning near- misses: the Confederates once nearly captured Vice President Andrew Johnson, and in another plot almost took possession of the only warship on the Great Lakes. They also engaged in a primitive form of biological warfare: collecting the garments of yellow fever victims and distributing them in Washington, D.C. (to no apparent effect). This narrative of Civil War intrigue is sprinkled with true tales of invisible ink, railroad sabotage, and prison escapes; in one remarkable episode, a Confederate spy dresses up like a lady, attends a soiree held by Union officers, and learns critical intelligence from his talkative dance partners. All told, this is an outstanding work of popular history on an aspect of the Civil War long kept hidden. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Duane Schultz has a Ph.D. from American University.

She lives in Medford, Oregon.<br>For the millions of women who experience a variety of unpleasant and stressful symptoms related to perimenopause, this book offers a straightforward discussion, explaining which medical tests and treatments, including alternative therapy, women should consider. Jackson, who owns a medical practice dedicated to hormonal health in Oregon, finds that women either have no symptoms, mild symptoms that become more pronounced right before menopause, or significant symptoms that require treatment in order to continue their daily routines. She explains the relationship among estrogen, progesterone and testosterone, and their impact on depression, sex drive, weight and headaches. And she presents her information clearly, explaining bodily functions in a way that lay readers can understand. Jackson is quick to suggest alternatives to medication such as stress reduction exercises, change in diet and exercise, although she also discusses the variety of estrogen and other hormonal treatments available. Appendices listing recommended reading for specific problems, products, vitamin and herbal supplement resources and hormone-testing labs, in addition to a glossary, add further value to this instructive book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although he was not chiefly a man of words, he wrote frequently on music during the course of his long life, and the writings assembled in this book date from 1906 until 1971. Klemperer writes here about musicians he knew and worked with, dwelling with especial interest and respect on Gustav Mahler, who was a formative influence on the young Klemperer. There are pieces on composers from Bach and Beethoven to Schoenberg and Zemlinsky, and on colleagues from Beecham and Toscanini to Ewald D�lberg and Max Reinhardt. He also documents his own career, discussing his conducting, his battle to save the Kroll Opera in Berlin, his period at Los Angeles, his return to Germany, his compositions, and much more. A great deal of the book has never been published before in English, and some sections appear for the first time in any language.</p><p></p><h2>Voices of the English Reformation: A Sourcebook</h2><p><p>Spanning the different phases of the English Reformation from William Tyndale's 1525 translation of the Bible to the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, John King's magisterial anthology brings together a range of texts inaccessible in standard collections of early modern works. The readings demonstrate how Reformation ideas and concerns pervade well-known writings by Spenser, Shakespeare, Sidney, and Marlowe and help foreground such issues as the relationship between church and state, the status of women, and resistance to unjust authority.</p><p>Plays, dialogues, and satires in which clever laypersons outwit ignorant clerics counterbalance texts documenting the controversy over the permissibility of theatrical performance. Moving biographical and autobiographical narratives from John Foxe's <i>Book of Martyrs</i> and other sources document the experience of Protestants such as Anne Askew and Hugh Latimer, both burned at the stake, of recusants, Jesuit missionaries, and many others. In this splendid collection, the voices ring forth from a unique moment when the course of British history was altered by the fate and religious convictions of the five queens: Catherine Parr, Lady Jane Grey, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, and Elizabeth I.</p></p><p><b>John N.

He later returned to the United States and died in 1962 in Conway, New Hampshire.K-Gr 2-Inspired by cummings's poem, which is presented in its entirety at the beginning of this beguiling book, Raschka's story echoes and expands on its themes of families and belonging. Delicate tiny vignettes decorate the text pages, which face full-page illustrations. Loose, geometric lines, skewed multiple perspectives, and childlike representations of people characterize these intricate, energetic watercolors. The story takes the little tree from his faraway forest home, via a little truck and a little train, "past the farms and little towns to the little big city," where he is purchased by a loving little family. In an engaging sideline, Santa appears in small scenes pulling on his boots, skiing, listening to music, and drinking a glass of wine at a caf&#x201a;. Final pictures reinforce the connection between the poem and the story. Visually, and as a simple, sweetly old-fashioned read-aloud, Little Tree embodies the warm sense of love and belonging that for many defines the true meaning of Christmas.-S.

In seven chapters, all written and lusciously painted by Wagner, the deadly cyborg Grendel-Prime pursues the past with singular purpose, even while the decadent and decaying world he has forsaken hunts him for reasons of its own.

Miraculously provided with food, but with no clues to the meaning of their strange new afterlife, billions of people from every period of Earth's history--and prehistory--must start again.<br><br>Sir Francis Bacon would be the first to glimpse the incredible way-station, a link between worlds.

His mission: to confront humankind's mysterious benefactors, and learn the true purpose--innocent or evil--of the Riverworld . . .</p><p><i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i> is the Hugo Award-winning beginning to the story of Riverworld, Philip Jos� Farmer's unequaled tale about life after death. When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom?<p> That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. <i>--Craig E.
